1,-1,"Will The U.S. See 100,000 Cases a Day?
Poor leadership, confusion, and hasty responses have turned into fodder for the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S.

Dr. Anthony Fauci addressed Congress and the nation on June 30th with a grim number, 100,000. The daily number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on that day was just above 40,000, higher than the peak days of April during national shutdowns, and the nation’s leading infection disease expert “would not be surprised” if the spread of that virus became over twice as worse. The number seemed large and far off into the future, but we are currently halfway there with continued increases feeling almost inevitable.

 

The congressional testimony called upon experts to shed light on vaccine developments, detail plans on how the country will expand testing, and continually urge Americans to wear masks and social distance while in public. Unfortunately, the testimony did not offer new methods for individuals to battle the virus, it was all old news. Practice social distancing and wear a mask.

States shutdown economies to stop a spread that could no longer be contained through contact tracing. These mitigation measures urge citizens to be socially distant and to wear a mask. The good news is that the drastic measures worked, the bad news is that not all region took drastic measures.

Crisis Progression and State Responses

The northeastern states were undoubtedly hit the hardest in the early days of the crisis. New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts had the nation’s highest case numbers, along with Rhode Island and Connecticut if adjusting for population. These states saw first-hand how pernicious the virus could be though the harm it caused to an individual’s health, its ability to spread quickly through assisted living facilities, and how it inevitably had hospitals overrun with patients. As the nation watched case number rising in hopes we would soon, “flatten the curve,” it was mainly these states that were driving the curves continued growth. Northeastern states issued stay-at-home orders and required masks in public, restrictions far more strictly that other regions. These strict, and by some seen as racial, limitations changed the future course of the viral spread in the northeast, but was not an adopted strategy by all the states.

Today, the states in the northeast have had steady case numbers since early June while other regions in the U.S. are all seeing growth, and at times exponential growth.

 

The projected progression of the spread of COVID-19 provided by the White House in April, it should be mentioned these projections were of deaths and not confirmed positive cases, looks strikingly like the blue line above that shows the virus progression in the northeastern states. The White House had hoped strict restrictions would contain the virus to a point that in the summer months it would be held at bay.

The southern, midwestern and western states all had slight peaks in April, and unlike White House projections, never saw meaningful declines in May. As we got to June these regions were at or above the numbers seen in the peak time of April. The differences seen in the progression of cases in different regions aligns with the quantifiable characteristics of each regions early socially restrictive measures against the virus.

Stay-at-Home Orders

 

The citizens of the northeast spent on average an additional two weeks under stay-at-home orders than the rest of the country. It is importantly to highlight that not all stay-at-home orders were the same and each state had control over what the details of the stay-at-home order meant. The American Medical Association issued a statement on April 3rd urging Governors to enact stay-at-home orders along with other policies to promote physical distancing as these measures were “crucial in limiting the virus’s long term effects on our country and health care system.” 

Mask Requirements at the Beginning of the Crisis

 

Wearing a mask, a newly politically fraught activity in the U.S., was almost universally required or advised in the northeastern and western states with less participation from the southern and midwestern ones. Despite early advise from medical professional, including Dr. Fauci, requesting that individuals to not stock up on masks from fears that hospitals would have shortages, it is now nearly universally advised by scientists and public officials while be required by some businesses. Wearing a mask even now has the support of President Trump, who for months refused to wear a mask in public, stating on July 21st in a renewed daily virus briefing that Americans should “wear a mask, get a mask” and gave his reasoning as “whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact.” This change of stance from the President is hopefully a turning point for his party and followers who have shown indifference towards the severity of the virus.

State Politics

Geographical regions within the United States had varied results in the spread of COVID-19, and geography may seem like a just attribute to define why and when the virus spreads, but the crucial decisions that needed to be made about the virus and the virus’ mere significance has been politicized since the first confirmed case in the nation. Republican controlled states (states with a Republican Governor and Republican Controlled House and Senate) generally treated the virus with less urgency and acted with haste to re-open their states. Republican leaders often followed the lead of President Trump who for months downplayed the virus, and even at one point wanted to have the country open for Easter, April 12th, a date in the middle of the peak of the first wave.

Republican states are now seeing an exponential rise in cases as we progress through the summer months.

 

The total population of states by party affiliation splits fairly evenly, 40% in Republican States, 40% in Democratic States, and 20% in Purple States. If we then look at the most recent daily case numbers and adjust them to the state’s population, it is striking to see the Republican states group towards the top.

 

Urging citizens to stay-at-home and wear a mask when they cannot, the two pillars of effective virus mitigation strategy were ideas not embraced by states with Republican leadership. Much like the regional differences in policies, party affiliation showed great differences in how states reacted.

 
 

Political division around the virus and effective mitigation strategies has been changing in recent weeks. Republican leaders at federal and state levels are beginning to publically acknowledge the current severity of the crisis and showing a new willingness to break from the President. Senator Mitch McConnell signified that he has “total” confidence in Dr. Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control to issue proper guidance on navigating the new surge in cases. With President Trump now distrusted by most Americans on the COVID-19 pandemic and slipping in the polls for his re-election, there is an opportunity for leaders to at federal and state levels to step up and follow the science that is factually proven to slow the spread of the virus.

What Happens at 100,000?

It is bad. However, if the United States reaches 100,000 new cases a day it does not mean that it will be in twice as worse shape as it was during the peak of the first wave saw 40,000 new cases a day. The reason for this is that deaths from COVID-19 are not spiking in the same manner as the first wave.

 

Thankfully, the large increase in confirmed cases has not resulted in a proportional increase in deaths. There are factors to consider in understanding why deaths have not risen in the same way. 

Deaths are a lagging metric. Individuals can be hospitalized for weeks, or even in some cases months, battling the symptoms of the virus. The new deaths created by the new confirmed cases today will likely not occur until mid-August. It is inevitable we will surpass a seven-day average one thousand deaths a day in the next couple weeks, if not week. There has been a 48% in daily deaths from the virus in the last two weeks. Another month of increases at that rate would put the United States at a 1,770 new deaths a day from the virus on August 18th, another two week period would bring 2,600 deaths a day on September 1st, which would put the U.S. into its new worse phase of the pandemic.  It may seem like a long ways to project out, but cases have been exponentially climbing for over a month, and it is reasonable to expect a similar increase in deaths because of it. 

It has widely been reported that younger people, a group less likely to get severely sick from the virus, are making up a larger majority of the new coronavirus cases in the U.S., and this may be another reason for the lower amount of deaths proportional to cases. Getting tested for the virus is also much more readily available that it was in April. Asymptomatic carriers of the virus are taking more tests now that they would have in April, and so the proportion of confirmed cases were the individual is severely sick has been decreasing. Both of these factors lead to numbers that show a virus that is currently less deadly than what was experienced during the first wave.

The last factor that may be making the virus less deadly, and the most scientifically controversial explanation, is that the virus is mutating. Virus that spread and are allowed mutate among a species always become more transmissible and less deadly. Genetic mutations of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have shown to happen in the matter of weeks, and it is possible the virus infecting American’s now is slightly different from the one infecting American’s in the spring. This is developing scientific research without a current agreed upon consciences.

The virus will continue to spread and infect people across the country for months until there is a vaccine that is available in hundreds of millions of doses. There will be a lot that changes and develops during that time, one of the most important being having schools back in session, and the nation will discuss how to react to those changes accordingly. What will not change is the scientific advice on how to live during a viral pandemic, stay at home when you can, and wear a mask when you cannot.",0
2,-1,"There are few documents in American history that can compare in importance to the Declaration of Independence, and the ideals expressed in that document were an exhibition of principles taught by colonial colleges which promoted the American Enlightenment movement. The history of the United States and the institution of higher education are intertwined and have greatly influence each other. This is proven as alumni of the early American colleges described themselves as, “Alma Mater of a Nation” (Thelin, 2011). Early leaders of these colleges were not only important to the education of students but were important figures of American history and the nations independence.	
	Thomas Clap, Yale College president from 1740-1766, and John Witherspoon, College of New Jersey president from 1768-1794, were two influenced college presidents of their time who instrumentally changed higher education. Thomas Clap was one of the first college presidents that ushered in the concept of having an external board that partnered with a strong operational president (Thelin, 2011). Clap’s popularity began to decline as his political and ideological views were in opposition of Yale’s board, tutors, and students. Geiger (2015) wrote that, “[Clap] rejected religious toleration within the college, censored library holdings, and argued that colleges are primarily for training ministers.” The conflict grew so tense at Yale that students boycotted and forced Clap to resign in 1766. When John Witherspoon took office at the College of New Jersey, now Princeton, he had a much more progressive platform that Clap and other predecessors. James Madison, Philip Fithian, Andrew Hunter, and many other students that went to the College of New Jersey while Witherspoon was president, became profound members in the revolution with ideas shaped in part by their education (Mailer, 2017). Early in his tenure Witherspoon demonstrated we was against the actions of the British Parament but was still loyal to King George III. Despite this contradiction, he became the only British Clergy man to sign the Declaration of Impendence (Mailer, 2017). Thomas Clap and John Witherspoon are two examples of leaders during the American Enlightenment and demonstrate the conflict between the traditional beliefs and those the American Enlightenment.
	Higher education today is still and institution that we as a society strongly believe in to conduct research and promote progressive agendas. A majority of our founding fathers received a formal education from a college or university, and today we generally want our government leaders to be educated individuals who obtain a college degree, or many. The idea of having social reform, the American Enlightenment and Revolution, be advanced through education, colonial colleges, is philosophical belief best described by reconstructionism. Reconstructionism is defined as, “a group of related curriculum proposals that…developed a distinct rationale and
proposal for advancing education as an agent for social reform” (Thomas, 2010). Thelin (2011) also identified this when he wrote, “College alumni certainly did not monopolize the intellectual and pollical leadership of the revolution, but they were a formidable presence.” America as a society looks to higher educational institutions to research and progress social ideologies which is a practice that started before the nation’s founding.",0
3,-1,"Urban expansion in the early United States was not entirely the result of the institution of higher education, but it was a significant factor. Education if fundamentally about the sharing and creation of knowledge and having a more educated community brings about social and economic advantages. Colleges and universities are of course not the only place where knowledge is shared and created, especially in the 19th century when the student body was often restricted to only the wealthy elite class, but as the enrolment numbers of modern colleges continue to rise it has become an essential professional development step in the careers of a growing number of Americans.
When the American colonies were founded it did not take long for the foundation of colleges and universities. In the time after the American Revolution when the United States was Expanding into the south and western regions of the country, new colleges and universities were being founded in these new communities. In the 19th century the majority of growth for new colleges and universities in the United States was in the south and western regions (Thelin, 2011). This growth of new schools is the result of wealthy families wanting to keep their college bound children within their home state or community and not send them off to colleges in the New England or the Mid Atlantic. South Carolina College and the University of Nashville are examples of schools founded with the intention of providing high quality education to students in the southern region. University of Nashville President Philip Lindsey believed students would lose respect for their home states if they left to get educated somewhere else, and the parents of these students believe the ideas being spread at colleges like Harvard and Yale were “dangerous” (Thelin, 2011). Establishing these schools in the south and west almost certainty avoided a “brain-drain” of the educated individuals of the region. The schools in the south and western regions, although generally only accessible to elite class, were essential to the local economies and growing these newly founded communities. The expansion of the United States into the south and western regions was linked to the foundation of new colleges and universities.
In the 19th century the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States were home to the well-established colleges Harvard, Yale, and William & Mary but were also gaining new schools to address the social demands of the time. Harvard, Yale, and William & Mary, and among other similar schools in the region, served the elite class. This phenomenon was illustrated best by Henry Adams when we he wrote about the students of Harvard. “For generation after generation, Adamses and Brookses and Boylstons and Gorhams had gone to Harvard, and… custom, social ties, convince, and above all, economy, kept each generation in the track” (Thelin, 2011, pg. 63). This proved the nature of these schools and how they intended to maintain the elite class. The foundation of new colleges including Amherst, Williams, Bowdoin, Dartmouth, and Wesleyan was done to cater to an older student body that most likely needed to work to earn their way through college (Thelin, 2011). Schools like the ones mentioned above proved to be essential in growing their local communities and economies. A significant portion of students were the later born children of farming families. Traditionally the first child took control over the farm and the other children needed to establish a new profession (Thelin, 2011). These new colleges for built around this type of student provide new professional options and social mobility. It is reasonable, if not undoubtable, to see the causational relationship between the growth of New England and Mid-Atlantic colleges and the urban expansion of the communities around them.
	American universities today are now serving more students, and importantly more types of students, then they ever have before. Traditional on-campus schools still serve the majority of students, just over 14 million, but the number of students taking at least some of their course online or by another type of distance education is increasing at a faster rate, the current number is just shy of 6 million (National Center for Education Statistics, 2018). This is vastly changing the landscape of higher education and how students are interacting with the institution. Colleges and universities still do well socially and economically for the communities around them by providing a young talented workforce. Adversely, communities without a local university can face issues with developing and maintaining workforce talent. Online education and distance learning has been the answer in these communities. It has been proven, both throughout history and looking at modern countries, that growth of per capita income and participation in higher education are linked (Marginson, 2016). Schools that provide online degrees open up opportunities for communities that lacked a school to help in economic growth. Colleges and universities have proven to be beneficial to the communities they are a part of, and online colleges are starting to share these benefits with all communities within the United States.",0
4,-1,"Improving student outcomes in higher education is a top objective of state and federal governments to not only ensure students are graduating with pertinent information, but also to guarantee government financial aid is a good investment. “Performance-based” funding is a key way that states, and the federal government, can use legislation to hold colleges and universities accountable. One state to do this is Colorado. In 2014 Colorado signed a bill into law requiring the Colorado Commission on Higher Education (CCHE) to appropriate state funds to state universities while considering not only role and mission, but performance (Colorado Department of Higher Education, 2015). Understanding how a state implements performance metrics for colleges and universities to determine funding is crucial for educators and legislators to create a better education system.
            An entirely “performance-based” model for state funding could result in very poor outcomes for student and educators. The saying, “you get what you measure,” is comes to mind. If state legislators impose certain criteria then schools, in an effort to compete, will gradually craft their policies and procedures to achieve the required outcomes, even if it goes against what would possibly be best for students. The initiative that Colorado took was multidimensional involving many parties including college and university governing boards, administrators, higher education advocates, students, faculty, nonprofit education organizations, and members of the business community (Colorado Department of Higher Education, 2015). The intentions of this law are to improve transparency around how universities and colleges should be conducting their service of education and what outcomes they should be achieving. Performance is also only one factor in the holistic process of determining how state funds get appropriated for higher education. To better conduct this holistic process, Colorado formed three teams meant to address specific areas in higher education. The teams are public educations and outreach, cost driver analysis, and funding allocation model (Colorado Department of Higher Education, 2015). At the core of this legislation Colorado is attempting to assert higher education as a public good of the state. This message can be seen in the following excerpt.
Higher education is an economic engine for Colorado, helps to create an informed citizenry, and contributes significantly to Colorado’s superior quality of life. In order to ensure the state’s ongoing social, cultural, and economic vibrancy, funding for higher education should be based on the needs of the state, the people of Colorado, and the students. (Colorado Department of Higher Education, 2015)
Overall the Colorado model of “performance-based” funding is effective because it is not rigid or inflexible, it allows legislators and schools to work together in improve the education system and not as separate entities.
            Performance funding has seen an increase in popularity across public higher education and it is partly due to the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. State budgeting for higher education was already seeing a decrease, but the financial crisis exacerbated that. The question of whether higher education was an essential public good was one that state governments had to answer. States like Colorado understood this importance and started to develop funding models that effectively distributed funds for higher education and maintain its public good. States that effectively constructed these performance-based, or renamed outcome based, policies and programs tended to have previous experience with these models, which is pretty intuitive, and were able to align higher education with other state and public goals (McGuinness Jr., 2016). Along with Colorado, states including Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, New York, Arkansas, Nevada, Louisiana, Connecticut, and Massachusetts are among some of the well preforming state higher educational systems. Accessibility, affordability, accountability, and success are common themes among these states, and it is from comprehensive legislation that incorporates law makes and educators (McHenry & Flora, 2017). Performance based funding is not an end all be all fix to public systems, it is, when done effectively, a part of a comprehensive process with the intention of bridging the gap between the interests of school administrators, state legislators, faculty, and students.",0
5,-1,"GI Bill and Contemporary Higher Education
	Mass-education initiated mainly by the GI Bill had important implications for higher education and its new approaches to curriculum, access to higher education, regulation, and the balance of staffing. The direct effect of the GI Bill on the roughly 30 years that followed caused some growing pains for colleges, but once reestablished, it revealed to be a transformative time. Curriculum was updated to meet the needs of changing student population, enrollments for higher education doubled from increased funding, accreditation and university standardization were leveraged to help grow the universities, and educators and administrators need to change from the traditional forms of teaching and student support to cater to the new diverse student population. Studying the GI Bill, its implications from 1945-1975, and its effects today are important in understanding how higher education grew to the mass-education system it is today.
Student Demographics and Program Offerings
When the GI Bill passed into law in 1944 the demographics of students who attended college quickly changed. Veteran students made up nearly half of the 2.3 million students in college (Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). Veterans were older than the traditionally aged college students, brought more maturity and a sense of hast to complete their degrees, and were generally the first in their family to go to college (Thelin, 2011). These differences because a challenge for admissions offices as they now needed to accommodate students with more diverse backgrounds and prepatory experiences. Because the GI Bill was an entitlement of all veterans, women and minorities were included and permitted to receive benefits. African-American veterans, at a time in this country were segregation was still legal, were able to receive these tuition benefits and enroll in college in greater numbers (Thelin, 2011). However, unlike the accreditation mandate that the federal government imposed on schools, there were no requirements of nondiscrimination. The GI Bill enabled the enrolment of many African-Americans students but still left racial barriers of entry that limited participation from maximum capacity (Thelin, 2011). Gender demographics were also affected from the GI Bill. Even though women veterans had higher participation rates in higher education than men, 30% to 18% respectively, the total number of male veterans enrolling far our numbered women (Thelin, 2011). The male dominated demographics of the military spilled over the higher education after the GI Bill became law. The large influx of veterans changed the population of students who attended college and made it older and more career focused.
Veterans students attaining college with benefits from the GI Bill viewed college much different than their tradition college student piers. Higher education for veterans was virtually about re-training them for a new profession. This did not align with the traditional structure. Colleges had to adapt and offer new or adjusted programs for these students. Employable educational programs such as business administration and engineering were highly favored among veteran students. Veteran students were generalized as being “pragmatic and impatient” which is seen as a key influence in why they tended to choose more employable degree paths (Thelin, 2011). The larger enrollments meant schools had to broaden their program offerings, specifically in employable fields, and also included the expansion of infrastructure on campuses. Construction of new laboratories, academic buildings, and student housing was needed in direct response to the GI Bill (Thelin, 2011). Expanding of program offerings, constructing new buildings on campus, and improving quality of education were all structural and systematic changes that colleges went through with the funding from the GI Bill.
Adapting to Mass Higher Education
	Student demographic changes set in place by the GI Bill influence colleges and universities to alter the way they functioned and served students. Geiger (2016) categorized the period between 1945-1975 as, “the most expansive in the American experience,” and, “the most tumultuous in the history of American higher education” (p. 24). Higher education was important to American society before the GI Bill, however, only about 5% of the population had achieved a college degree. By 1970 that percetage doubled (Percentage of the U.S. population…, 2017). Higher educational institutions needed to expand each aspect of their school while continuing to provide quality educational experiences to students. This period in higher education after the GI Bill was categorized by expansion and standarization (Geiger, 2016). Undergraduate enrollment grew by nearly fivefold while graduate education grew by ninefold (Geiger, 2016). Schools responded to this growth along with the advent of regional accrediation boards by becoming more standarized. Best practices were developed by higher educational instituions around course offerings, faculty training, and administrative practices (Geiger, 2016). The immence growth in enrollment from the GI Bill briefly made an overcrowed industry, but eventually improved the quality and overal outcomes of highe education.
Higher Education for Workforce Training
The GI Bill at its inception was a bill that wanted to retrain and prepare veterans, and essentially the country, for a new peacetime economy. The tuition benefits provided to veterans is still present today along with other stipends for additional living expenses. Exploring the historical context of the GI Bill and where it was effective can be valuable in improving how to achieve veteran student success today.
The GI Bill has been a continuously updated piece of legislation since it became law in 1944. The New GI Bill, or post 9/11 GI Bill, is the most recent version of the mainly tuition assistance program and was instituted in August of 2009. Included in this newest revision are larger tuition benefits and coverage for livening and academic expenses not covered by tuition (Zhang, 2018). In the article “Veterans Going to College:  Evaluating the Impact of the Post-9/11 GI Bill on College Enrollment,” Zhang (2018) concludes through research that while New GI Bill has significantly increased enrollments among veterans through tuition and other finacial assistances, these students still face issues while trying to attending school including but not limited to service related injuries or disabilities and being of a non-traditional age. Meeting these needs of veteran students’ needs to be a key objective for schools when trying to educate them. 
The College of Nursing at Roseman University of Health Sciences was awarded a grant in 2015 to develop and Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) targeted for veterans. The objectives of this program were to; increase the enrollment of veterans in its BSN program, allow veterans to apply knowledge gained while serving toward their degree, create and environment to address the physical, emotional, and environmental needs of veterans, ensure high employment placement rates for graduates, and place graduates in medical facilities that serve underserved populations (Hurlbut, 2018). To achieve these goals Roseman University needed to contrive a robust structure to support these veterans while they were at school. Developing an advisory committee to oversee the project, training advisors to understand the specific needs of veterans, awarding credits through prior learning assessment, and establishing communal areas on campus were key initiatives the school took to meet the needs of veterans (Hurlbut, 2018). The College of Nursing at Roseman University is a leading example of how schools are adapting to meet the needs of veterans to achieve goals set by the university and the federal government through the GI Bill.
GI Bill and Modern Higher Education
The GI Bill initially instituted in 1944 influence on how we understand higher education today. The understanding that higher education needs to accessible to all students and prepare graduates for the workforce were ideals cemented in the years following the GI Bill. College accessibility and government regulation are key areas in higher education to analyze when seeing the impacts of the GI Bill in modern higher education.
College Accessibility. The GI Bill has been labeled the beginning of the mass-education movement in the United States (Thelin, 2011). College enrollments have continued to grow since it became law and this is mainly from the enactment of federal financial aid, a law that followed the GI Bill. The GI Bill created the framework for the government providing aid to millions of Americans to attend school, but in the modern world, the new college accessibility problem is mainly around student debt. $1.5 trillion is the current amount of student debt in this country and the federal government has been a main issuer of that debt. Increasing accessibility along with increasing tuition prices has created a new problem for students, colleges, and the government that will take new innovations and legislation to resolve.
Government Regulation. The state and federal levels of government and their duties in higher education have changed due to the GI Bill. State governments and the public schools that operate under them have needed to play increasing rolls in understanding the needs of veterans and designing programs or support structures around them. The federal government has continued to play and ever-increasing role in allocating funds to ensure the education of veterans. The Higher Education Act of 1965 and the educational amendments in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 were laws shaped in part by the GI Bill (Bahr & Gross, 2016; Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). The success the GI Bill has had for veterans and the nation as a whole created an imperative for the federal government to allocate funds for tuition assistance as a means of investing in the nation’s economy and the well-being of its citizens. The GI Bill set a precedent for how government at the state and federal level can play a role in improving higher education.



Conclusion
	The GI Bill was the first major initiative the federal government took to open up opportunities for more student to attached college in the U.S. With raising tuition prices, many believe that higher education is still not accessible enough for most Americans. It is important to put historical context on the modern situation and understand how far the U.S. has come in achieving higher accessibility and mass-education for individuals that want to go to college. Federal aid in cooperation with state governments and schools will continue to be the means at which we achieve a truly accessible higher education system that educates Americans, including veterans, for the modern economy.",0
6,-1,"Discrimination, Diversification, and Access in Higher Education
Higher education is an institution built around the idea of knowledge creation and democratic expansion that needs to address the challenges of discrimination, diversification, and access to achieve this mission. Applying philosophical models to actions that universities take to address each of these issues allows for a holistic assessment of the action and how to apply it to other schools in different environments. Addressing discrimination, diversification, and access are a part of the foundational values that higher educational institutions espouse.
Discrimination
	A pinnacle objective of education is to produce a more equal and democratic society. However, the communities that schools build both inside and outside of the classroom is a mere subset of the larger environment of which they operate in. Historically black colleges are a prime example of how universities apply the esthetics philosophical theories to combat discrimination. Benjamin Elijah Mays, Howard Washington Thurman, and Martin Luther King Jr. were three individuals that influence Morehouse College in addressing segregation in the U.S. and framing education as a holistic and individualized experienced (Jensen, 2017). Mays, the 6th president of Morehouse college, most clearly exemplifies this as he had the objective, with respects to segregation, to “unshackle the minds of Negro youth, loose the chain from the Negro’s soul, and free his heart from fear and intimidation so that he will be able to develop whatever gifts God has given him” (Jensen, 2017, p. 148). The theory of pedagogical personalism was born out of this perspective. This theory holds each and every person as sacred under God with nothing of higher value (Jensen, 2017). Pedagogical personalism is most closely linked to the esthetics branch of philosophy because it addresses the individual needs of every student to form an educational curriculum advocating for desegregation. Applying pedagogical personalism in a university setting is a productive way of addressing discrimination.
Diversification
	Creating diverse program options and delivery methods are important facets of colleges and universities to improve their effectiveness for a diverse student base. Confronting large complex issues that require critical thinking are objectives that schools have students examine to better prepare them for once they graduate. Metaphysics as a branch of philosophy addresses the importance of exploring a topic or idea to establish acceptance of the truth, which is then understanding. Acting out scenarios as a student to establish understanding of a particular area of study is effective, and especially when the subject is more complex. Computer-based learning experiences that used problem-solving scenario frameworks have been shown to successfully prepare students for real-life issues once they leave school (Sonnleitner, König, & Sikharulidze, 2018). Researchers used this learning method to engage student when trying to learn complex and uncertain areas of ‘sustainability science’ (Sonnleitner, König, & Sikharulidze, 2018). Students who used these computer-based scenario learning experiences were shown to gather more pertinent information when initially given an issue to solve and were more likely to produce creative solutions (Sonnleitner, König, & Sikharulidze, 2018). Allowing students to learn through these activities is a way the universities can create more diversity is its educational delivery and use principles of the metaphysics branch of philosophy.
Access
	Building programs in higher education that are more accommodating to students and allow for greater access to underserved populations is arguably the most important issue facing the institution in the modern day. The philosophical branch of ethics is the obvious framework that should be applied to addressing the issue of access in higher education. Saar, Täht, and Roosalu (2014) pose a very important question on this topic, “In what ways do higher education systems indeed contribute to lifelong learning, and to what extent can adult learners become full participants within the mainstream higher education institutions?” (p. 692). Producing life-long learning is a common value or goal among colleges and universities, but with high tuition prices for many schools, especially traditional formats, it is important to question if schools are doing enough to enable life-long learners in the educational system. This brings up the ethical question of how much education should be guaranteed to members of a society and how much should each individuals responsibility to pay for, and also what should schools do to allow all types of students to obtain a degree. Saar, Täht, and Roosalu address these questions in their research and concluded on three proposals. Shorter-duration programs of study, distant learning education options, and a student financial-aid system that caters to underserved markets, mainly adults, are all methods to improve access for students left out of traditional models of higher education. Applying ethics to the issue of access in higher education is a key way of employing the policies that schools and governments have already taken using them in new markets.
Conclusion
	The issues of discrimination, diversification, and access that face higher education are all being solved in certain ways by different colleges and universities in collaboration with state and federal governments. Understanding the philosophical perspectives of each issues enables a greater understanding of the root of an issue and allows individuals to apply one method or practice to another school or community. Reflecting on the nuances of each issue and how it affects certain communities is the beginning of creating solutions that are relevant and yield greater outcomes.",0
7,-1,"Personal Philosophy for Higher Education
Higher education is a pillar of democratic societies and serves many different functions in each. Developing a personal philosophy must incorporate the large scope of duties affiliated with the institution of higher education, and it must also be continuously revised to meet modern issues and demands that arise. Epistemology and ethics were the two branches of philosophy that chiefly influenced my personal philosophy towards higher education. For me, epistemology relates to my unrelenting search to determine why we all perceive the world differently and how we can use these perceptions to establish a more accurate truth. Ethics relates to my passion for making higher education for accessible to underserved demographics and fulfilling the ultimate goal of higher education by establishing systems that empower life-long learners. I merge these two ideas when I constructed my personal mission statement which reads, “I want to build and maintain educational experiences that promote social justice, individual well-being, and career achievement that fosters social and economic stability in our communities.” The central idea of the mission is that it is about a journey towards a more ideal model, not a concrete attainable goal. There are many modern academic models that align with this mission, but there are also many historical moments where individuals made decisions or actions in pursuit of a similar mission. Identifying and analyzing those decisions and acts will solidify the importance of reaching for a most just system of higher education. Strong institutions like higher education that are constantly, and diligently, maintained help sustain strong societies that grow and prosper.
Application of Philosophy
         A personal philosophy is undoubtedly linked to personal experiences and beliefs, so establishing validity of a philosophy needs to be completed by examining the efficacy of programs or actions that are aligned with that philosophy. Taking both a historical and modern perspective, there are many instances of individuals or schools acting in a manner that was influenced by the ideals promoting social justice, individual well-being, and career achievement. Those actions have generally created a benefit for society at large by improving personal and professional outcomes of large sections of the population. Integrating philosophies with actions is important in ensuring the actions are guided by a central mission or values system.
Historical Examples for Providing Access
         Higher education in some accepts has always held a certain zeal of exclusivity. Initially only the sons of rich families would go to colleges. There are now millions of students enrolled at a higher educational institution. Throughout history there were many steps to get to the model system we have today that reaches a larger percentage of the population that it did before. The GI Bill is an important piece of legislation that guided the path of higher education. Put into law in 1944, the GI Bill initially was only centered on employment and medical benefits as a way to help soldier re-adjust to civilian life (Thelin, 2011). A late addition to the built were the college tuition benefits which are what it is most known for today. This was the first major act of the federal government providing aid directly to students to go to college. It was immensely successful. College enrollments nearly doubled from 1944 to 1946 with veterans making up around 1 million of the 2.3 million enrolled colleges students Two years after the bill became law in 1946 there were 1 million veterans enrolled in a college or university (Thelin, 2011; Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). Veterans were generally first generation colleges students and saw great improvement in both career and social outcomes comparative to the state they were at before going to school (Thelin, 2011). Schools who were first apprehensive towards the idea of more veterans attending college quickly saw the benefits and drove many schools to market directly towards these students and updated degree programs that better suited the interests of veterans.
Greater access lead to a more fair and just educational system that was continued under the administration of President Harry Truman. President Truman founded the Commission on Higher Education with the goal of better understanding the purpose and role of higher education and how it influences the nation (Thelin, 2017). The commission produced reports that were the foundation of federal involvement in financial aid, expanding higher education to more students, and the desegregation of schools (Thelin, 2017). These ideas are commonplace in modern times but were revolutionary for mid 20th century. Higher education was gaining more support from the federal level as its importance was recognized. However, not all the conclusions that were reached by the Commission on Higher Education were implemented right away. It was a couple decades before Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson would start enacting on the principles. The important connection to make is how increasing access to higher education through the GI Bill set into place a chain of events that affected higher education, and also the wider culture of the United States. Improving access has shown to have historical importance in creating a more just system that improve the personal and professional outcomes of many Americans.
Modern Examples for Providing Access
         The federal government has continued to be a key influence on improving access to higher education mainly through financial aid, but the modern times are requiring more changes of the school’s themselves to achieve greater access. Students almost universally have access to federal aid in the form of either grants or loans. With increases in tuition prices at exponentials levels that far surpass inflation students are being left with larger financial loan burdens. The current number is around $1.5 trillion (Friedman, 2018). The issue is now less, “Can an individual go to college,” and more, “Can an individual afford to go to college.” The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FASFA) has become a more streamlined process than in previous years which allows students to, once enrolled, have funding for their education. Holding schools accountable to provide affordable education options that position students to achieve ‘gainful employment’ after school is the modern challenge the institution and policy makers are facing. Influenced by philosophies around affordability and providing meaningful experiences the benefits the person and the community at large are playing out in the United States and need to be adopted by more schools to combat the challenges being faced.
         Affordability, flexibility, and workforce relevance are three guiding principles that are driving much of the innovation that is occurring in the higher educational industry. The traditional model of education is perceived by many as a static structure that will not be changed, but models are challenging the traditional models that have been in place for hundreds of years. Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) developed a three-year bachelor’s degree program designed to address affordability concerns with the traditional campus experiences and provide integrated competency-based learning opportunities that are more relevant to workforce demands (Southern New Hampshire University, 2019). Students learn through normal classroom experiences, but also experiences including internships and case studies that count as credit towards their degree. SNHU has also been a leader in educational experiences built for the non-traditional or adult learner. SNHU has a traditional campus environment along with online courses, but is innovating with its experiential learning models including its workforce partnership and merger with the non-profit LRNG to deliver higher education in underserved communities (Keane, 2018; Southern New Hampshire University, 2019b). Community colleges are also changing their curriculum and deliver methods to promote most engagement of adult learners and achieve life-long learnership. Serving students in a “skills-builder” or “stackable-credentials” model are two ways community colleges are doing this (Bahr & Gross, 2016). Skill-builders are students who are seeking out individual courses instead of degrees to obtain or refresh knowledge on specific skills needed in their professional careers. Stackable-credentials are degree programs that are broken down into a set of credentials that students can work at over time to achieve their specific degree (Bahr & Gross, 2016). Working to address the needs of students, in both traditional and non-traditional means, that improves outcomes and establishes are more just environment align with the philosophy the higher education should promote social justice, individual well-being, and career achievement.
Historical Examples of Educational Models
         The progression of higher education throughout American history has been towards models that provide greater access to students and achieve a social good. Horace Mann and James B. Conant are two important leaders and reformers in higher education that established models profoundly influencing higher education. Horace Mann held a firm belief that education should provide and equal opportunity to all people to progress their own personal knowledge. He was a founding member of the Massachusetts Board of Education which unified schools into a statewide network to provide universal, non-sectarian, and free education to children (Cremin, 2019; Cubberley, 1947). Mann furthered his influence into higher education when he became president of Antioch College, a school dedicated to providing education to African American students during a time of racial segregation in the United States (Cremin, 2019). Harvard University president James B. Conant served from 1933-1953 and progressed the notion the schools should provide financial-aid assistance to students in need. The idea that access to higher education and academic achievement should not be determined by social background was groundbreaking at the time (Urban, 2010). It was often the presumption that the financial burden of going to school was solely on the student and the student family, but Conant set a standard for schools to bear some of the financial burdens (Thelin, 2011). Establishing models for universally accessible educational institutions that assisted students without financial was progressed by the work of Horace Mann and James B. Conant.
Modern Examples of Educational Models
         Online education created a profound shift in higher education and changed the population of students able to earn their degree. It is important to examine these models identify key ways in which they how they may progress into the future. Online course offered by colleges and universities are generally asynchronous and employ a style of instruction called interteaching. Interteaching includes guided instructions, study guides, student to student interactions, and instructor feedback while sometimes being supported by lectures (Brown, Killingsworth, & Alavosious, 2014). For online education delivery, student learning is guided by the instructor and student to student discussions while supported by readings in a text book and other resources. Because they are generally asynchronous, lectures are not a large portion of instruction. These methods have been shown to be beneficial for students learning. Research done on online instruction showed the students, both groups were online students, performed better on tests and retained more knowledge when interteaching was leveraged as opposed to lectures (Gayman, Hammonds, & Rost, 2018). It is generally inconclusive if traditional in-person lectures or instruction produce better result and knowledge retention than online education. Online education has shown to be an effective means of instruction and there are new advancements to improve student outcomes and experiences even more.
         Competency-based education and the gamification of learning are driving schools to update their curriculum because of the positive outcomes they both produce. Competency-based education takes away the standard credit hour model of higher education. There are no “seat-time” requirements for students, once students show they have learned a certain competency or set of competencies they move on to the next module. This model is conducive with affordability and flexibility that non-traditional students require. Employers also prefer these programs because they see student graduate with applicable and relevant workforce knowledge (Hansen, 2018). Prior learning assessment is another way schools are assessing students and providing credits without making a student sit through a class. Students earn credit towards their degree for work they have already completed greatly reducing the cost. Cost savings are not the only impact, student outcomes improve as well (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2017). Gamification is transforming learning into a game that naturally motivates learners to interact and engage with content that they need to learn. We play games because they are fun, reduce stress, and remove use from mundane tasks or activities, all of which are by products of school and studying (Kaufmann, 2018). Online learning companies like Smartsims, which specializes in applied games for business students, teach business fundamentals along with analytical skills and cross-functional management in a hands-on experience (Smartsims, 2019). The future structure of higher education will continuous change to better reach and educate students.
Personal Philosophy
         Addressing my personal philosophy through a modern and historical lens is essential in determining its relevancy and validity. I have broken my statement down into three parts and examined it to the application of other philosophies mentioned above.
Social Justice. Higher education, and the U.S. culture at large, has progressed towards a more socially just atmosphere. Key progressives like James B. Conant understood the higher education was not serving as a socially just body to students with modest financial backgrounds. Access to higher education was an ethical imperative and creating more robust financial-aid system allowed for a more diverse class of students. This sentiment has carried through to today as schools like SNHU are developing online programs which reach more students at an affordable price. The access to student loans has allowed more students to get access to funds, but the tuition prices have burden students with large amounts of debt. Making school more affordable is an important way of maintaining of a level of socially just.
Individual Well-Being and Career Advancement. The GI Bill radically changed higher education, but it also changed the personal and professional outcomes of the new class of veteran graduates. Graduates saw and increase in earnings which lead to an improvement of social class as many students were first generation college students. Community colleges are applying some of the same principles today be engineering curriculum to better suit adult or non-traditional learners. Many of these students only need certain classes to see an improvement in professional and social outcomes. These students also generally have a full-time obligation while attending school. Creating programs for “skill-builder” type students through “stackable-credentials” is a clear effort in schools adapting studies to better meet students’ needs of achieving individual well-being and career advancement.
Social and Economic Stability in our Communities. This is closely tied to “individual well-being and career advancement,” but it is on the macro-level for society. Horace Mann understood the social need for universal, non-sectarian, and free public education that started in childhood. He brought these beliefs with him as the president of Antioch College where he persisted on allowing African Americans to study at the school. These broad social policies improve the social and economic stability of entire communities. Competency-based education with prior learning assessment is poised to have a similar impact in modern communities. Many individuals who can’t afford or don’t have the time to attend school needs a curriculum that is customized for them and provides them the ability to applying what they are learning directly to their job. Partnering with employers is a great way to offset the costs for students and provide them with a college degree to advance in their career. Competency-based education can reach a very broad demographic of people in need of education and transform communities into more prosperous entities.
Conclusion
         Applying a historical and modern perspective to my personal philosophy maintained its value and reliance and upheld its strength as a guiding philosophy I will continue to apply to my career in higher education. Moving from industry to academic was one of the first actions that I took to fulfill this philosophy. I joined SNHU as a Junior Business Analyst working mainly on campus to help departments and stakeholders on campus operate more efficiently and effectively while leveraging data to inform decisions. My personal philosophy is very broad and working towards it in its entirety would be an incredibly cumbersome task. I plan to use it as a guide for my decisions and actions in my professional career, and hopefully, eventually leading a university.",0
8,-1,"GI Bill and American Access to Higher Education
	The GI Bill, officially called The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, is most widely known for its appropriations of federal funds to provide full tuition and hosing coverage to veterans returning from World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, along with congress, understood there was an immense need to provide retraining and welfare assistance to help veterans re-adjust to society at home and move the nation towards a peacetime economy. What could be the most interesting aspect of the GI Bill is that its most recognized feature, federal aid for college tuition, almost did not become law at all. This as the last amendment added to the GI Bill. Higher education saw an incredible change as a result of the GI Bill where enrollments doubled at most college and universities in the two years that followed its inception. There were many political, economic, and social factors that took place during the time of the GI Bill in higher education, as well as the American nation, that proved to be transformative change to shape the modern world today. 
Political Factors of the GI Bill
	The GI Bill passed in 1944 and almost only included medical and employment benefits for veterans returning home from World War II, with no mention of any educational benefits (Theline, 2011). Certain legislators along with the American Legion were advocating for education benefits, a topic that divided congress. Deliberations would continue during most of 1943 until it narrowly passed, with only a one vote majority, in 1944 (Thelin, 2011). This defined the political atmosphere of the time. Political leaders where fight over the cost of implementing this federal aid system, which in 1946 resulted in the federal government spending the equivalent of $48 billions of today’s dollars just for the education part of the GI Bill, and if it would be effective (Thelin, 2011). Veterans who served their time were granted education aid for tuition, fees, books, and supplies up to $500 a year with the only conditions being that the university or college needed to be accredited (Thelin, 2011). The accreditation requirement was added as the federal government was concerned with veterans falling victim to “diploma mills” which where institutions profiting off of tuition dollars and hardly offered any instruction. However, the federal government did not want to play a role in determining which colleges were nationally accredited, so in response, regional accreditation boards were established to govern the process of accrediting colleges and universities. The federal government has continued to stay out of the accreditation process so this time in U.S. history defined the process that is in place today. Political factors played a role in the formation of the GI Bill, as well as, maintaining its effectiveness to ensure a societal net benefit. 
Economic Factors of the GI Bill
	The GI Bill was enacted by congress in 1944 which made in on five years removed from the Great Depression of the 1930’s. The nation was rebuilding during the early 1940’s and it was also fighting a world war. When it became understood the Allies were going to win the war effort congress and the white house knew they needed a plan for a “peacetime economy to would maintain social order” (Thelin, 2011, p. 262). The Great Depression of the 1930’s was ended by the legislative efforts in Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, legal proposals designed to increase American prosperity, and the increased government spending from World War II (Rauchway, 2008). Large economic stimulus, as seen most recently in the U.S. during the 2008 economic crisis, increases the flow and exchange of money in a given economy which in turn creates jobs, increases individual incomes, and increases gross domestic product. All these factors play a role in national well-being. The GI bill was reasonably economic stimulus for higher education. In two years, the GI Bill put 1 million veterans in colleges and universities across America (Thelin, 2011). The financial contributions towards higher education from this influx of veteran students allowed universities to make investments in their campuses through new facilities – classrooms, dormitories, and sport facilities among others – and increasing the number of staff personnel (Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). Federal spending and legislation surrounding the New Deal and the GI Bill brought America out of the Great Depression and lead to a society which began to prosper.
Social Factors of the GI Bill
	Political support of the educational benefits in the GI Bill was initially not strong which was a reflection of the public views. When World War I veterans returned home many of them found it very difficult to adjust. This was mainly because of the lack of federal aid provided to help with readjustment. If efforts to protest, veterans set up “Hooverville” camps near the White House during the Great Depression to express the mistreatment they received once returning home (Thelin, 2011). The GI bill initially included medical and employment benefits for veterans to help alleviate this issue, but the educational benefits were more difficult to get passed. Political leaders were divided on it, and even college officials voiced their hesitations. Many officials wanted to hold onto the traditional idea of higher education and focus on educating more students that fit that traditional image (Thelin, 2011). This ideology was very short lived. Two years after the bill became law in 1946 there were 1 million veterans enrolled in a college or university (Thelin, 2011). These students made up nearly half of all student in higher education which stood at 2.3 million in total (Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). Colleges and universities quickly saw the benefits of having veteran students and began marketing to this demographic. The excerpt below if from a Harvard brochure intended for military personnel or veterans.
“Harvard recognizes that the veteran of this war will expect something else from education than the ordinary peacetime student. Clearly the man who has been making life and death decisions at sea, in the air, and on the ground has other ideas than the man who comes direct from high school. The University is bending every energy to meet the needs of these men.” (Thelin, 2011, p. 264)
Social attitudes quickly changed once the GI Bill became law and it forever changed the landscape of students who attended college and how the institutions themselves operated.
Influence on Contemporary Higher Education
The diverse new student population of veterans created a new challenge for college admissions. With admissions responsible for making decisions on advanced placement and waivers for course requirements, among many other difficult decisions involved with who to accept, using traditional measure was not going to work. Admissions departments needed new and faster way to assess students and make decisions on applications (Thelin, 2011). Military training and experience would now be considered for veterans, but importantly for all other traditional students, there was increased usage of standardized testing in admission decisions (Thelin, 2011). The SAT and GMAT are widely required for today’s colleges and universities that have stringent admission requirements and this idea was born during this time in higher education. Standardized testing doesn’t provide a full picture, but with the pressure of quickly processing applications, it provides a quantitative assessment of a student’s academic strength. The GI Bill was also a big driver in the federal governments taking on more responsibilities when it came to higher education. The 10th amendment of the constitution outlines that, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people” (The Constitution of the United States, 2011). Higher education had almost solely been under the direction of the state’s due to this amendment, but the GI Bill prompted President Harry Truman to extend the federal governments roll in higher education. Truman created the Commission on Higher Education with the role of determining, “ways and means of expanding educational opportunities for all able young people” (Thelin, 2011, p. 268). This commission pioneered many initiatives that addressed the injustices in higher education with the goal of promoting social justice, but the ideas did not have political backing at the time. It wouldn’t be until the presidencies of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson that these initiatives took hold (Thelin, 2011). Federal intervention in higher education through financial aid has expanded from the GI Bill through modern times. Two key pieces of legislation were the Higher Education Act of 1965 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. The Higher Education Act of 1965, under the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, allocated federal funds for student aid and was targeting low income students (Bahr & Gross, 2016). ARRA was in direct response to the 2008 financial crisis, and the federal government provided funds to state government to increase their budgets for higher education, which were decreasing from the losses in tax revenues (Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). Federal financial aid is a vital role that the federal government plays in higher education.
Leadership Philosophy in Higher Education
	James B. Conant was the president of Harvard University during the years on 1933-1953 and was a key visionary in higher education during his tenure. Initially a chemist, Conant understood the importance of the sciences in higher education and made it a key role in his personal agenda for the university. However, his influence outside the university was most profound for his ideas and practices towards increasing accessibility for more types of student in higher education. Urban (2010) had this to say when writing about Conant’s educational philosophy:
“Conant championed a system of educational opportunity that sought to enrich society with the contribution of high academic achievers, whatever their social background.” (p. 193)
This “system of educational opportunity” that Urban describes is best outlined in Conant’s financial aid efforts for Harvard students. In 1937 he dedicated substantial financial aid resources to providing Harvard scholarships to applicants from regions outside the Northeast. This created a national competitiveness between the nation’s top schools to find talented students regardless of geography or family income. This shifted admission dominance away from affluent students from a small number of private boarding schools (Thelin, 2011). The idea of need based financial aid was not as ubiquitous as it is today, and Conant’s ideas transformed college admissions at many schools for decades. Thelin (2011) captured the significance of the moment in a passage from the textbook A History of American Higher Education.
“Its historical importance lay in its novelty. It was such a conspicuous exception to the rule of institutional and family expectations about how a college education was to be financed demonstrated just how widespread the presumptions were that applying for a college education was a burden for the student and family, not the intuition, to bear.” (p.254)
James B. Conant was not only a visionary for establishing an ethos around educational opportunity, but he was a visionary for taking the initiative and being a leader in the institution of higher education.",0
9,-1,"Personal Mission Statement for Higher Education in a Modern World
	My personal mission for my career in higher education is to develop and maintain educational experiences that promote individual well-being and career achievement that foster stronger economic stability in our communities. Higher education in America has many different delivery styles that serve different types of student, and in developing a personal mission for myself it was critical for me to identity a delivery style and student demographic that was important to me. The role online education will have on adult learners is what I focused on when developing my mission. I believe that in the coming years due to job loss from automation there will be large population of Americans in need of professional development. Higher education is the platform that I believe will facilitate a large part of this professional development and learning for adults. My mission is tied to maintaining this nation’s social need for a strong economy and high quality of living despite the technological threats.
Higher Education’s Impact on Me
	Attending college after high school was thought of as a requirement in my educational career, but much like high school itself, had a very shallow purpose and overall objective. As it related to me, the purpose of high school was to, beyond participated in sports each season, get into college, and the purpose of going to college was to get a job. My perception of an educational career was a series of steps that ended upon graduating from college when the “real world” began. I believe this to be a common perception for many kids and young adults who are either college students or college bound high schoolers, and the ideology is flawed. The greatest lesson that I learned from college which changed my perspective of education is that it, in its many forms, is a part of an individual’s personal development, and should be thought of as complimentary to one’s professional career. Having a continuous educational career will aid individuals in progressing the ranks at one’s job or offer retraining to purse something entirely new. My experiences with education and the idea that higher education should be a continuous journey has been the most influential idea in shaping my educational purpose and my motivation to understand the current state of higher education and it’s opportunities for growth and improvement.
Current State of Higher Education and External Forces
	The projected number of students enrolled in some form of post-secondary education for fall 2018 is 19.9 million students (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2018). Although this is below fall 2010 enrollment of 21 million when post-secondary education was at its peak, enrollment numbers are expected to steadily grow in the coming years. This growth proves that some type of post-secondary education is gaining popularity among the lives of Americans (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2018). This trend does bring about one large problem, the student debt crisis. There is currently $1.5 trillion dollars in outstanding student loan debt (Friedman, 2018). Even with enrollment projected to grow, it is still important to identify the traditional barriers of entry to attend college, tuition prices and flexibility of access. The traditional method of a college education works best for traditional college students who are between the ages of 18-24 and can afford to attend or have the ability to take out loans. Nontraditional students, generally adults who have another full-time or part-time obligation while attending school, require a more flexible model that is also more affordable. Of the 19.9 million students projected to be enrolled in a post-secondary institution for fall 2018 around 14 million are entirely traditional students, taking no classes with an online or alternative structure, and the remaining 5.9 million are taking at least one class in this category (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2018). The share of student that take online classes, also known as distance learning, comparative to the total number of post-secondary students is expected to grow steadily into the future. Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor, stated in a speech at he predicts that in the next ten to fifteen years the number of colleges and universities will be cut in half due to bankruptcy as a result of the disruptive forces of online education (Hess, 2017). This statement may be exaggerated as it is often difficult to identify when a new product or service is truly disruptive in the market, but there are many external forces that are making the case of continued growth in online and alternative classes and degree structures.
	Online learning has been gaining popularity, but only a small portion of this growth is from traditional students. Adult learners are the ones who make up the majority of students who take online classes (Ke & Xie, 2009). This is no accident, as online classes are more flexible and affordable which are key requirements for adult learners. Adult motives for going to school are similar to traditional students but are mainly focused around achieving a better job/career, improvement in lifestyle, interest in social responsibility, and inspiration from friends and family (Van Rhijn, Lero, & Burke, 2016). The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning has identified ten principles that universities need to leverage effectively to reach adult learners. These principles are; adaptivity, assessment of learning outcomes, financing, life and career planning, outreach, strategic partnerships, student support systems, teaching learning process, technology, and transitions (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2018). Recent improvements in technology have resulted in job loss for low skilled workers and there is a lot of evidence this trend with not only continue but accelerate. This acceleration of job loss will create immense pressure for post-secondary educational institutions to design scalable degree programs to meet the needs of workers who could see their jobs disappear. 
Andrew Yang, and American entrepreneur and founder of Venture for America, believes the automation of jobs is the single greatest crisis America is about to face, and it inspired him to become a presidential candidate for the 2020 election. He writes in his book The War on Normal People (2018) that, “83 percent of jobs where people make less than $20 per hour will be subject to automation. Between 2.2 and 3.1 million car, bus, and truck driving jobs will be eliminated by the advent of self-driving vehicles” (Yang, p. 2). This will create a fundamental shift in the lives of millions of Americans and their families. Jobs provide people with purpose and a social structure essential for general happiness, not to mention an income. There will be many factors that will need to be leveraged to establish good jobs for these American’s, but one key factor will be education. Online education, in its many forms, will be needed to provide the American people with a structured way to learn a new skill and develop a new profession. Programs like Southern New Hampshire Universities’ College for America have been developed in response to pressures from the labor market. College for America is a competency-based educational system that focuses on affordability for student and workplace relevance for employer in pursuit of scalable model that can educate thousands of students to meet workforce demands (Clerkin & Simon, 2014). Programs like College for America will need to be adopted by more universities and colleges to effectively meet demands that will be created by job loss through automation.

Personal Goals and Objectives
	Higher Education will see and exponential increase in demand in the future from adult learners, and this understanding has inspired me to start a career in higher education to help meet the demand. Online programs are now well established in higher education, but there will be a lot of pressure to scale these programs while keeping them affordable and of high quality. I want to play a role in this, and I developed a personal mission statement to hold myself to this.  After developing a mission statement, it is important to visualize how that mission will manifest in a career, and I answered four key questions below.
Actions to take in higher education. Pursuing a career in education can take many routes. I am choosing to go the administrative route in hopes to play a role in establishing and maintaining new educational delivery methods for a new demographic of adult students. 
Daily Professional Life. Each and every day I will be working either for or towards attaining this mission. It is important to have a motivator in your life, especially with work, and I want to constantly remind myself of why I am in higher education.
Personal Values. My most important personal value is family, but with relation to higher education, my main values are purpose, equality, continuous learning, and understanding. It is important to develop educational methods at are centered around a strong set of values and are also student-focused.
Higher Education and Society. Education in the broadest sense is the sharing and generation of knowledge to attain a greater truth. We all should hope to be educated to be socially engaged member of society, but education also plays role in workforce training. A strong workforce leads to a strong economy which improves the quality of life for an entire nation. The role higher education plays in society cannot be overlooked.",0
10,-1,"John Dewey and World War I on Higher Education
John Dewey, a philosopher of the mid 20th century, has had a profound impact on modern day philosophical thought through both his theories and actions. Dewey was a university professor at the University of Minnesota, University of Michigan, University of Chicago, and Columbia University and was routinely progressing ideas around philosophy (Shook, 2010). The endeavors or actions the Dewey engaged in were guided by his fundamental beliefs around social justice and liberal democracies. Labor unions, civil/women’s rights, progressive education, and world peace were among the main guiding principles the Dewey believed in (Shook, 2010).
The personal philosophy of John Dewey was in part grounded in the ideal of democracy and throughout his life he enacted on this ideal. Before World War I John Dewey was deeply against violence and military intervention. He saw violence as “unmitigated nonsense” and democracy and peace as strategic measures to resolve issues (Howlett & Cohan, 2016). However, the actions of Germany leading up to the war changed his perspective on the war effort, and he eventually came to the understanding that military intervention is sometimes necessary for long lasting peace (Howlett & Cohan, 2016). This is an important change in ideals to identify and it is not because John Dewey went against his principles, but because he stuck to them. He placed great value on long term sustainable world peace and was willing to adjust his thoughts on military intervention instead of inflexibly sticking to his original thoughts. He never fully believed that war was constructive way of achieving goals but understood that with complex international issues there needs to be an intricate approach. Dewey continued to enact on his personal philosophies concerning democracy by traveling around the world to different locations to act as a philosopher, political and social thinker, and educational advisor (Shook, 2010). Spending a considerable amount of time in both Japan and China, Dewey made it his mission to conduct lectures educating the citizens of those nations of the importance of democracy and how to obtain it (Howlett & Cohan, 2016). John Dewey’s activism in the social and political space were constantly guided by his personal philosophies.
	World War I was a profound event in U.S. history that changed the trajectory of U.S. higher education. Once the U.S. entered the war there were many young individuals who would join the war effort, so of them being colleges students. Harvard and Yale saw 40% reductions in enrollments while other schools on the east coast saw reductions that were slightly less significant (Thelin, 2011). This obviously put considerable pressure on schools to recuperate the revenues they were no longer receiving from the decreased enrollments. One thing that schools did were become training campuses for military personnel (Thelin, 2011). This was mainly out of desperation to make up for lost funding, although it ended up changing the public image of higher education. Universities were seen as aligning with the national war effort by contributing ready and able personnel (Thelin, 2011). Higher educational institutions gained public approval, as well as, the approval of President Woodrow Wilson. The event of World War I greatly impacted higher education and forced it to slightly depart from its traditional model and align more with the national interest to maintain financial viability and gain public approval.",0
11,-1,"The GI Bill and Contemporary Higher Education
            Federal funding and student aid in higher education has allowed the entire industry to expand and improve access to students to enable a more educated society. The GI Bill of 1944 was the federal government's introduction into federal financial aid for higher education and assisted in the forming the standard that is follows today to improve access for students. Today, the ease of access to federal funds allows students to secure funding to attend the school and degree program of their choosing. Although better access is being achieved through federal financial aid, recent trends of tuition increases for both private and public schools has spurred an exponential increase in student loan debt which currently sits at $1.5 trillion. Tuition hikes are caused by a myriad of inputs, but one is that that the price elasticity for college tuition has become relatively inelastic allowing schools to increase budgets and tuition prices. As a result, students are taking out loans to attend colleges that can lead to financial hardship upon graduation. The GI Bill and federal legislation around financial aid that followed it allowed for better student access, however, it also shifted some responsibly on student access and affordability concerns from states to the federal government. Analyzing the historical circumstances that lead to the GI Bill and the implications that are being played out today in higher education is crucial in developing knowledge of the current state of higher education and how to establish new legislation to combat the current conditions.
Historical Analysis of the GI Bill
            The GI Bill, official known as The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, was the first piece of major federal legislation that appropriated federal funds towards higher education. The foundations of the bill are still in place today as military members receive tuition benefits for college along with other finical benefits after their service. However, the implications of this bill have affected far more than just military students. The initial GI Bill in 1944 nearly double college enrollments by 1946 because of the influx of veteran students. This propped up the budgets for colleges allowing them to improve their campuses and facilities. Federal aid played a direct role in the mass higher education movement that following in proceeding decades and is also the primary source of enabling student accessibility today. Modern colleges still heavily rely on federal dollars to operate as a majority of students receive loans and grants to pay for school. Political, economic, and social factors that surround federal financial aid are all impacted by the GI Bill and its significance. Addressing these factors helps inform the causal relationship the GI Bill has in modern higher education.
Political Factors
            College tuition was not a part of the initial GI Bill and was a difficult battle to win politically to have it added. The American Legion worked with certain legislators in favor adding college tuition to the bill, and after nearly a year of deliberation, it passed by a one vote majority in 1944 (Thelin, 2011). Any act of congress almost certainly has several political factors influencing it and the GI Bill was no exception. The price tag of this bill was a major reason for this. By 1946 the federal government spent the equivalent of $48 billion on educating veterans in higher education (Thelin, 2011). The amount of federal investment in higher education motivated congress to develop a means of ensuring schools that received federal funds were properly using those funds to educate students. Regional accreditation boards were born from this need and these agencies are still the main governing bodies of higher education today (Thelin, 2011). The GI Bill also forever changed how the federal government involves itself with higher education. The key legislative milestones of President Lyndon B. Johnson were associated with his Great Society civil rights inactivates, one of them being the Higher Education Act of 1965. The overarching purpose of this act was to provide financial assistance to students pursuing education past high school or secondary school (National TRIO Clearinghouse, 2003). That U.S. constitution left the responsibility of operating and funding higher educational institutions to the states, but the GI Bill followed by the Higher Education Act of 1965 positioned the federal government as a main funder of higher education through grants and loans (The Constitution of the United States, 2011). Contemporary politics in the U.S. around funding for higher education continue to lead in the direction of more federal spending and the issuing of loans.
            Access and affordability are two key political issues that contemporary legislators are having to tackle as student debt in this country is exponential growing while there are still underserved populations in the educational system. The federal loan and grant programs are directly related to solving both of this issue. The Pell Grant was instituted to offset the cost of higher education for students and federal student loans are in place to provide secured funding to students to pursue their education. Access to higher education in all demographics has increased in higher education with peak enrollment being 21 million students in 2010 (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2018). Enrollment decreased in the following years after 2010 but has been increasing again and is currently at around 20 million students (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2018). Access to higher education has been greatly improved in part by the federal government, but affordability has seen little improvements. Federal spending certainly helps with pay for tuition, but the increases in the overall cost of tuition have far surpassed the increase in federal grant appropriations. State governments, which drastically decreased spending on higher education following the 2008 financial crisis, are starting to take a more active role in addressing the affordability issue. Tennessee, Arkansas, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Rhode Island all have public schools or community colleges that offer free or greatly reduced tuition (Mercer, 2018). There are several other states that are making moves towards free public colleges but are all in various stages of appropriating the funds. The political responsibilities that the federal government gave to itself through the GI Bill and The Higher Education Act is slowly being transitioned back to the states to develop more affordable options for colleges that also improve access. A joint effort between states and the federal government is going to be necessary in addressing the contemporary political issues of access and affordability.
Economic Factors
            The heart of the GI Bill was it was initially proposed was federal aid to veterans to help in readjusting back into society along with economic stimulus to transition the U.S. from a wartime to peacetime economy. During the 1940’s the U.S. was still reeling from the effects of the great depression of the 1930’s. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s constructed The New Deal which was a collection of legislative actions intended to stimulate and prop up the economy. Federal spending from The New Deal and World War II were major drivers in returning the U.S. to a prospering economy (Rauchway, 2008). Higher education saw drastic expansion as a result of the GI Bill. One million veteran students were enrolled in higher education by 1946, only two years after the bill was signed into law (Thelin, 2011). Veterans made up nearly half of all college students during this time. Universities made large investments in their campuses building new facilities – classrooms, dormitories, and sport facilities among others – and increasing the number of staff personnel (Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). This investment in colleges campuses has continued to grow as schools compete to provide the best educational experiences possible for students. The competition has adversely affected the tuition costs of both public and private colleges as students are less incentivized, because of federal aid, to choose lower cost options of achieving a degree and more incentivized to choose “the best school.”
            Paying for tuition is one of the main inhibitors of going to college for most students and is the driving reason the federal government has expanded its distribution of grants and loans. This method helps tens of millions of students every year earn their degree, but there are economic costs that student incur upon graduation when they have large amounts of debt. The Bennett Hypothesis, developed by former Education Secretary William J. Bennett under President Ronald Regan, drew the connection between large increases in tuition prices at school of higher education to the large availability of federal student aid and loans for students. In the Bennett Hypothesis universities are able to raise tuition rates without seeing decreases in demand because of the ability for student to secure funding (Robinson, 2017). There is much political discourse around this hypothesis, and some is at least partly due to the fact Bennett served under a republican administration, as many people who understand the importance of higher education believe it is a framework the justifies politicians in drastically cutting federal investment in higher education (Strauss, 2012). It is important to remember that Bennett himself was not a believer in federal aid being the sole reason for increases in tuition costs, but that federal aid through grants and loans, at least partly, disincentives students to choose low cost educational options compared to more expensive options that provide better services (Robinson, 2017). Schools can more easily increase their revenues by increasing tuition as few students will be lost because of demand. These revenue increases are not simply going to profits for most schools, they are being invested in new facilities, more staff and faculty, and improving technology, student services, and recruitment and retention methods (Johnstone, 2016). Generally speaking, in the Bennett Hypothesis there is not stakeholder in higher education that is acting in a way separate of the interests of students, however, the educational system as a whole has drastically increased its costs to attend under the current conditions of federal financial aid and is leaving students with large amounts of debt upon graduation.
Social Factors
            The society during the time of the GI Bill had a large influence on how political leaders approaches and framed the legislation. The end of World War I was a difficult time for veterans who served in the war. Readjusting to civil society was incredibly difficult for veterans and the federal government offered little help with the transition. “Hooverville” camps were set up outside the White House to protest the inaction of the federal government (Thelin, 2011). Once it was clear the allies were going to be victorious in World War II, federal legislators started drafting the Servicemen's Readjustment Act which would become known as the GI Bill (Thelin, 2011). The educational benefits in the bill did not have large amounts of approval from both political leaders and professions in higher education. Educators were more focused on providing education to traditionally aged students and did not believe federal funding for educating veterans would be successful (Thelin, 2011). However, after the bill was passed the perceptions that educators and society at large had about higher education drastically changed. College was no longer an endeavor only meant for the elite class, it was a new way that individuals the modest socioeconomic backgrounds could improve their standard of living and socioeconomic class (Thelin, 2011). The demographics of students earning a college degree changed, and as a result, the program offerings did as well. Veterans students were more interested in business and engineering type programs and forced universities to invest heavily to create programs that fit this new social need (Thelin, 2011). Seeing this success and improvements in program offerings, university administrators changed their views on veteran and other non-traditional students. The following excerpt from a Harvard brochure intended for military personnel and veterans exemplifies this.
“Harvard recognizes that the veteran of this war will expect something else from education than the ordinary peacetime student. Clearly the man who has been making life and death decisions at sea, in the air, and on the ground has other ideas than the man who comes direct from high school. The University is bending every energy to meet the needs of these men.” (Thelin, 2011, p. 264)
Federal spending on higher education has continually increased from the GI Bill and a main reason for this is because of high value society puts on earning a college degree and its importance in the current labor market.
            Employers in the modern workforce are looking for college graduates to fill open positions which has resulted in students believing that a college degree is the only way to attain meaningful employment in their profession careers. The percentage of young individuals in the workforce, 25-29, who earn a college degree has been increasing very steadily from one generation to the next. Four-in-ten millennial workers have a college degree, 40%, compared to 32% of gen xers and 26% of baby boomers (Graff, 2017). The modern workforce is also demanding more workers earn some type of degree or engage in post-secondary education. One third of jobs in the United States require some level of education past high school, and this percentage is increasing (Toprey & Watson, 2014). Individuals who earn college degrees are much more likely to find employment compared to those without one. Employment for high school graduates is around 72% in this country compared to college graduates which is around 86% (National Center for Education Statistics, 2017). College graduates are also expected to earn more over their lifetimes than non-college grad with many analysts putting the figure around one million dollars. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce put the value of a college degree at $2.8 million over the lifetime of an individual (Carnevale, Rose, & Cheah, 2011). Federal and state governments also understand the importance of having an educated society and are drafting legislation to increase access while making college more affordable (Mercer, 2018; The White House Archives, n.d.). Student, employers, and the U.S. government all put an incredibly high value on higher education which is influencing its proliferation and increased attainment amount American citizens.
Synthesis of Modern Political, Economic, and Social Factors
            The political, economic, and social environment of the U.S. has shaped, both its exceptionalities and inadequacies, what higher education is today. The GI Bill is an important historic event and act of legislation that directly relates to the issues the U.S. is facing today. The political actions to improve college access, the economic circumstances that make it possible to finance a college education, and the social value society places on earning a degree has made a system that is educating more students than previous generations but leavings these students with large amounts of debt. The political system needs to be concerned with improving access to post-secondary education but needs to realize not all students can, or should, attend a traditional four-year school. Improving access to affordable and flexible opportunities for adult or at-work learners will be important in a future where the U.S. has a more educated society. The economic circumstances in the U.S. should incentive students to earn a college degree that make both professional and financial sense for students. Evaluating schools on their student outcomes is important to ensure that tuition dollars are being used effectively and working lenders to assure students are taking out loans that they can pay back in a reasonable and timely manner are essential to improving post-graduate circumstances for students. The social value of earning a college degree will continue to go up but reframing what a “post-secondary education” is will help alleviate the social pressures students face. Competency-based education and micro-credentials are two models that can be leveraged to provide students with the knowledge they need for the workforce while saving them both time and money compared to a traditional degree. The environment of political, economic, and social factors that the U.S. higher education system operates in need to be updated to better serve the modern needs of students and society.
Leadership and Educational Models in Higher Education
            The individuals leading the institutions and agencies in higher education have been heavily influenced by the effects of the GI Bill and how it set a president for expanding access to more citizens. These leaders, while being guided by their renewed philosophies, developed models for higher education with the intention to serve more students and improve student outcomes. Examining contemporary and historical leaders and the educational models they created is crucial in determining and understand of how to create a future in higher education where there is a diverse selection of methods in attaining a degree.
Leadership Philosophies
            James B. Conant was the president of Harvard University from 1933-1953 – before, during, and after the GI Bill became law – was instrumental in changing the perspective on how colleges and universities should improve accessibility for students. Conant was a chemist and had a deep belief that the sciences were important degree programs to offer students but is more widely known for providing financial resources from the Harvard University and providing them to students in need and from locations other than the northeast (Thelin, 2011). Urban (2010) wrote about Conant’s impact on higher education and had this to say about his philosophy:
“Conant championed a system of educational opportunity that sought to enrich society with the contribution of high academic achievers, whatever their social background.” (p. 193)
This shift in thinking impact higher education in two keys ways. One was that a competitive recruiting culture was made among universities. Schools now were looking through the whole country to find quality students and providing scholarships for them to attend (Thelin, 2011). Two was the burden of financing higher education was starting to shift from the students and their families to also included the school itself. Thelin (2011) wrote about this important shift in the textbook A History of American Higher Education and stated:
“Its historical importance lay in its novelty. It was such a conspicuous exception to the rule of institutional and family expectations about how a college education was to be financed demonstrated just how widespread the presumptions were that applying for a college education was a burden for the student and family, not the intuition, to bear.” (p.254)
Contemporary leaders in higher education have built upon the beliefs and philosophies of James B. Conant and incorporated the new landscape of which higher education now operates in.
            The modern higher educational environment would not be the same without the efforts of President Paul Leblanc of Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). Online education has been a main driver in change for higher education and SNHU is one of the largest providers of online education and it is unique as it is a non-profit as opposed to a for-profit university. Creating this large online presence that can reach hundreds of thousands of learners is integrated into the universities mission, a mission heavily influenced by President Leblanc. Leblanc outlines SNHU existences and core purpose as, “transforming the lives of students” (Leblanc, 2019). These students are often non-traditional college students of which “college is not a guarantee” (Leblanc, 2019). He attributes his version of achieving the American Dream to be directly influenced by his ability to receive high quality and affordable education (Leblanc, 2019). SNHU educates around 130,000 learners as of the present day and by 2023 wants the number to be around 300,000 (Southern New Hampshire University, 2018). The development of its College of Online and Continuing Education, College for American/Workforce Partnerships, and refugee education programs have been conducted all in service to the mission of the university and President Leblanc. Paul Leblanc helped develop a new understand on higher education in the modern world and how to proliferate education to all sectors of society.
Educational Models and Programs
            The advent of more flexible and affordable educational programs proved not only the social necessity for a more educated society, but the large amount individuals who want to pursue a degree but do not have the means to. Online education is the most popular form of non-traditional education in the U.S. currently, but is by no means the only one. However, online education addresses a majority of the issues key stakeholder in higher education are facing; accessibility, affordability, flexibility, and relevancy. The GI Bill was signed into law to help veterans readjust back into civilian society. The educational component was added because of the understanding that the veterans had the potential to be active members in the new peace-time economy but did not have the education or knowledge to do so. There are thousands of Americans that this fact relates to, having potential to achieve more but not having the means to learn our get educated to do so. Modern educational models like online education were developed to unlock the potential of thousands of Americans much the tuition benefits in the GI Bill.
Accessibility.
Online education has the ability to be accessed by anyone who has the ability to connect to the internet. This along with federal funding have creates an environment where individuals interested in pursuing a degree can do so. When strictly discussing access to consume information and knowledge to complete a degree, online education has hurdled a majority of the access obstacles. Some academics propose that the mere ability to complete a degree online does not fully address the accessibility question when quality of education is taken into consideration (Lee, 2017). However, the evidence that online education does not delivery quality learning, when controlled for programs that require in-person instruction, compared to traditional models is largely unfounded (Brown, Killingsworth, & Alavosious, 2014; Gayman, Hammonds, & Rost, 2018; Hansen, 2018).
Affordability
            Online education is generally far more affordable than programs offered in a traditional setting. Because they are also accessible to students, choosing an online degree makes sense for thousands of non-traditional students who are working. The cost per credit hour is usually less expensive, but there are other costs savings that online students benefit from. These included housing costs, the ability to work and go to school at the same time, transportation costs, and fees associated with being an on-campus student. These costs savings are important to the general demographic of students pursuing degrees online.
Flexibility
            Online education in an asynchronous design is a far more flexible option for students than the traditional structure. Asynchronous means that teachers and professors do not have any mandatory meeting times where all students need to attend. Learning is completed by the student on their time and when they see fit. This is similar to self-guided learning, but the school is providing a course framework that students follow to learn deemed important by the school or professor along with supplemental self-guided learning.
Relevancy
            Online education has been challenged by some educators and students arguing that it does not deliver quality of relevant education. Research does not show that online education is inherently worse than traditional education, and because so, online education is as, if not more relevant, than traditional forms of education. There are two strong cases for online education being more relevant than traditional education when relevancy is defined as workforce preparedness. First, students are able to pursue a degree and work at the same time. Education is not merely understanding theories and ideas, it is having the ability to apply those ideas. Have a job that allows a student to apply what they are learning in class greatly improves retention (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2017). Second, online education can be delivered in methods that do not function around the credit hour. Competency-based education is a model that many online, and also in-person, educators are employing so students focus on learning competencies that relate the job market and not seat time or credit hours (Clerkin & Simon, 2014).
Conclusion
            An historical analysis of the GI Bill and the issues it was enacted to resolve allow for a deeper understanding of contemporary higher education and how to solve problems going into the future. Federal funding has been the more influential driver for the expansion and accessibility of a college degree in the U.S. from its inception with the passing of the GI Bill. Federal funding has in part allowed for colleges and universities to increase their tuition prices at a rate that far outpaces inflation as more students are gain access to funds and deferring most payments until graduation. Improved access has led to large amounts of student debt that educational leaders have attempted to combat with more affordable education options including online education. Federal and state governments need to work together to develop open and accessible educational opportunities at little cost to students to relieve them of student debt. Online education has improved the accessibility, affordability, flexibility, and relevancy of obtain a degree in higher education, and as it progresses, will hopefully counteract some of the forces that have cause large amounts of student debt in this country. The GI Bill was intended to improve access to higher education for veterans, but it created a president in federal spending that ended up also expanding access to millions of students in the U.S. Improve education in the future will require adapting the principles outlined in the GI Bill to the modern needs of the U.S. society and economy",0
12,-1,"Personal Philosophy: A Historic and Contemporary Analysis
Higher education is a pillar of democratic societies and serves many different functions in each. Developing a personal philosophy must incorporate the large scope of duties affiliated with the institution of higher education, and it must also be continuously revised to meet modern issues and demands that arise. Epistemology and ethics were the two branches of philosophy that chiefly influenced my personal philosophy towards higher education. For me, epistemology relates to my unrelenting search to determine why we all perceive the world differently and how we can use these perceptions to establish a more accurate truth. Ethics relates to my passion for making higher education for accessible to underserved demographics and fulfilling the ultimate goal of higher education by establishing systems that empower life-long learners. I merge these two ideas when I constructed my personal mission statement which reads, “I want to build and maintain educational experiences that promote social justice, individual well-being, and career achievement that fosters social and economic stability in our communities.” The central idea of the mission is that it is about a journey towards a more ideal model, not a concrete attainable goal. There are many modern academic models that align with this mission, but there are also many historical moments where individuals made decisions or actions in pursuit of a similar mission. Identifying and analyzing those decisions and acts will solidify the importance of reaching for a most just system of higher education. Strong institutions like higher education that are constantly, and diligently, maintained help sustain strong societies that grow and prosper.
Application of Philosophy
         A personal philosophy is undoubtedly linked to personal experiences and beliefs, so establishing validity of a philosophy needs to be completed by examining the efficacy of programs or actions that are aligned with that philosophy. Taking both a historical and modern perspective, there are many instances of individuals or schools acting in a manner that was influenced by the ideals promoting social justice, individual well-being, and career achievement. Those actions have generally created a benefit for society at large by improving personal and professional outcomes of large sections of the population. Integrating philosophies with actions is important in ensuring the actions are guided by a central mission or values system.
Historical Examples for Providing Access
         Higher education in some accepts has always held a certain zeal of exclusivity. Initially only the sons of rich families would go to colleges. There are now millions of students enrolled at a higher educational institution. Throughout history there were many steps to get to the model system we have today that reaches a larger percentage of the population that it did before. The GI Bill is an important piece of legislation that guided the path of higher education. Put into law in 1944, the GI Bill initially was only centered on employment and medical benefits as a way to help soldier re-adjust to civilian life (Thelin, 2011). A late addition to the built were the college tuition benefits which are what it is most known for today. This was the first major act of the federal government providing aid directly to students to go to college. It was immensely successful. College enrollments nearly doubled from 1944 to 1946 with veterans making up around 1 million of the 2.3 million enrolled colleges students Two years after the bill became law in 1946 there were 1 million veterans enrolled in a college or university (Thelin, 2011; Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). Veterans were generally first-generation colleges students and saw great improvement in both career and social outcomes comparative to the state they were at before going to school (Thelin, 2011). Schools who were first apprehensive towards the idea of more veterans attending college quickly saw the benefits and drove many schools to market directly towards these students and updated degree programs that better suited the interests of veterans.
Greater access lead to a more fair and just educational system that was continued under the administration of President Harry Truman. President Truman founded the Commission on Higher Education with the goal of better understanding the purpose and role of higher education and how it influences the nation (Thelin, 2017). The commission produced reports that were the foundation of federal involvement in financial aid, expanding higher education to more students, and the desegregation of schools (Thelin, 2017). These ideas are commonplace in modern times but were revolutionary for mid 20th century. Higher education was gaining more support from the federal level as its importance was recognized. However, not all the conclusions that were reached by the Commission on Higher Education were implemented right away. It was a couple decades before Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson would start enacting on the principles. The important connection to make is how increasing access to higher education through the GI Bill set into place a chain of events that affected higher education, and also the wider culture of the United States. Improving access has shown to have historical importance in creating a more just system that improve the personal and professional outcomes of many Americans.
Modern Examples for Providing Access
         The federal government has continued to be a key influence on improving access to higher education mainly through financial aid, but the modern times are requiring more changes of the school’s themselves to achieve greater access. Students almost universally have access to federal aid in the form of either grants or loans. With increases in tuition prices at exponentials levels that far surpass inflation students are being left with larger financial loan burdens. The current number is around $1.5 trillion (Friedman, 2018). The issue is now less, “Can an individual go to college,” and more, “Can an individual afford to go to college.” The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FASFA) has become a more streamlined process than in previous years which allows students to, once enrolled, have funding for their education. Holding schools accountable to provide affordable education options that position students to achieve ‘gainful employment’ after school is the modern challenge the institution and policy makers are facing. Influenced by philosophies around affordability and providing meaningful experiences the benefits the person and the community at large are playing out in the United States and need to be adopted by more schools to combat the challenges being faced.
	State governments are starting to adopt public educational systems that provide higher education at no cost to students to improve access and affordability. Modern politics in the U.S. outline this objective as radical, but taking a historical perspective, it seems like a natural progression. The work of educators including Horace Mann helped universalize free public primary and secondary education out of the social need. The federal government has limitations to the aid it can provide to students and should not be in the business of completely covering the costs of college tuition. Colleges would not be incentivized to keep tuition prices low as the price of tuition would no longer be related to student demand. Free college in public state schools which is funded by state appropriates would be an effective means of diminishing income inequality and bridging the skills gap in the modern workforce (Perna, Leigh & Carroll, 2017). An important distinction that will play into the effectiveness of public stat schools will be the sustainability of the programs. The 2008 recession lead to many states having to cut budgets. Ensuring another economic downturn doesn’t eliminate funding for these schools is important in a long-term sustainable model that provides free accessible higher education for students (Perna, Leigh & Carroll, 2017).
Affordability, flexibility, and workforce relevance are three guiding principles that are driving much of the innovation that is occurring in the higher educational industry. The traditional model of education is perceived by many as a static structure that will not be changed, but models are challenging the traditional models that have been in place for hundreds of years. Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) developed a three-year bachelor’s degree program designed to address affordability concerns with the traditional campus experiences and provide integrated competency-based learning opportunities that are more relevant to workforce demands (Southern New Hampshire University, 2019). Students learn through normal classroom experiences, but also experiences including internships and case studies that count as credit towards their degree. SNHU has also been a leader in educational experiences built for the non-traditional or adult learner. SNHU has a traditional campus environment along with online courses, but is innovating with its experiential learning models including its workforce partnership and merger with the non-profit LRNG to deliver higher education in underserved communities (Keane, 2018; Southern New Hampshire University, 2019b). Community colleges are also changing their curriculum and deliver methods to promote most engagement of adult learners and achieve life-long learnership. Serving students in a “skills-builder” or “stackable-credentials” model are two ways community colleges are doing this (Bahr & Gross, 2016). Skill-builders are students who are seeking out individual courses instead of degrees to obtain or refresh knowledge on specific skills needed in their professional careers. Stackable-credentials are degree programs that are broken down into a set of credentials that students can work at over time to achieve their specific degree (Bahr & Gross, 2016). Working to address the needs of students, in both traditional and non-traditional means, that improves outcomes and establishes are more just environment align with the philosophy the higher education should promote social justice, individual well-being, and career achievement.
Historical Examples of Educational Models
The progression of higher education throughout American history has been towards models that provide greater access to students and achieve a social good. Horace Mann and James B. Conant are two important leaders and reformers in higher education that established models profoundly influencing higher education. Horace Mann held a firm belief that education should provide and equal opportunity to all people to progress their own personal knowledge. He was a founding member of the Massachusetts Board of Education which unified schools into a statewide network to provide universal, non-sectarian, and free education to children (Cremin, 2019; Cubberley, 1947). Mann furthered his influence into higher education when he became president of Antioch College, a school dedicated to providing education to African American students during a time of racial segregation in the United States (Cremin, 2019). Harvard University president James B. Conant served from 1933-1953 and progressed the notion the schools should provide financial-aid assistance to students in need. The idea that access to higher education and academic achievement should not be determined by social background was groundbreaking at the time (Urban, 2010). It was often the presumption that the financial burden of going to school was solely on the student and the student family, but Conant set a standard for schools to bear some of the financial burdens (Thelin, 2011). Establishing models for universally accessible educational institutions that assisted students without financial was progressed by the work of Horace Mann and James B. Conant.
Modern Examples of Educational Models
Online education created a profound shift in higher education and changed the population of students able to earn their degree. It is important to examine these models identify key ways in which they how they may progress into the future. Online course offered by colleges and universities are generally asynchronous and employ a style of instruction called interteaching. Interteaching includes guided instructions, study guides, student to student interactions, and instructor feedback while sometimes being supported by lectures (Brown, Killingsworth, & Alavosious, 2014). For online education delivery, student learning is guided by the instructor and student to student discussions while supported by readings in a text book and other resources. Because they are generally asynchronous, lectures are not a large portion of instruction. These methods have been shown to be beneficial for students learning. Research done on online instruction showed the students, both groups were online students, performed better on tests and retained more knowledge when interteaching was leveraged as opposed to lectures (Gayman, Hammonds, & Rost, 2018). It is generally inconclusive if traditional in-person lectures or instruction produce better result and knowledge retention than online education. Online education has shown to be an effective means of instruction and there are new advancements to improve student outcomes and experiences even more.
The idea of higher education is very closely tied to the idea of earning a 4-year college degree. Part of the initiative to improve access to higher education may be to expand the post-secondary opportunities in higher education. Vocational are often though of as entirely separate of higher education but can offer individuals the ability to learn a skill that improves their economic status. Students who start a vocational program in secondary school, high school, and continue it past graduation has high rates of graduation or competition, higher that general 4-year colleges students (Farias, & Paola Sevilla, 2013). These same students who try to change their degree or transfer to a 4-year school see a significant decline in completion rates (Farias, & Paola Sevilla, 2013). Conclusions can be drawn about how to effectively engage with these students to ensure they are completing their degree programs in both scenarios. Expanding vocational programs and staff support for students will still not address all the barriers students face. Researchers found the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students in urban environments faced simple barriers including logistical issues, lack of academic resources needed for school, and lack of social support (Eastman, Christman, Zion, & Yerrick, 2017). Improving access to higher education for every citizen will require community investment to ensure students have the means, resources, and support the achieve the degrees they want to pursue.
Competency-based education and the gamification of learning are driving schools to update their curriculum because of the positive outcomes they both produce. Competency-based education takes away the standard credit hour model of higher education. There are no “seat-time” requirements for students, once students show they have learned a certain competency or set of competencies they move on to the next module. This model is conducive with affordability and flexibility that non-traditional students require. Employers also prefer these programs because they see student graduate with applicable and relevant workforce knowledge (Hansen, 2018). Prior learning assessment is another way schools are assessing students and providing credits without making a student sit through a class. Students earn credit towards their degree for work they have already completed greatly reducing the cost. Cost savings are not the only impact, student outcomes improve as well (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2017). Gamification is transforming learning into a game that naturally motivates learners to interact and engage with content that they need to learn. We play games because they are fun, reduce stress, and remove use from mundane tasks or activities, all of which are by products of school and studying (Kaufmann, 2018). Online learning companies like Smartsims, which specializes in applied games for business students, teach business fundamentals along with analytical skills and cross-functional management in a hands-on experience (Smartsims, 2019). The future structure of higher education will continuous change to better reach and educate students.



Personal Philosophy
Addressing my personal philosophy through a modern and historical lens is essential in determining its relevancy and validity. I have broken my statement down into three parts and examined it to the application of other philosophies mentioned above.
Social Justice. Higher education, and the U.S. culture at large, has progressed towards a more socially just atmosphere. Key progressives like James B. Conant understood the higher education was not serving as a socially just body to students with modest financial backgrounds. Access to higher education was an ethical imperative and creating more robust financial-aid system allowed for a more diverse class of students. This sentiment has carried through to today as schools like SNHU are developing online programs which reach more students at an affordable price. The access to student loans has allowed more students to get access to funds, but the tuition prices have burden students with large amounts of debt. Making school more affordable is an important way of maintaining of a level of socially just.
Individual Well-Being and Career Advancement. The GI Bill radically changed higher education, but it also changed the personal and professional outcomes of the new class of veteran graduates. Graduates saw and increase in earnings which lead to an improvement of social class as many students were first generation college students. Community colleges are applying some of the same principles today be engineering curriculum to better suit adult or non-traditional learners. Many of these students only need certain classes to see an improvement in professional and social outcomes. These students also generally have a full-time obligation while attending school. Creating programs for “skill-builder” type students through “stackable-credentials” is a clear effort in schools adapting studies to better meet students’ needs of achieving individual well-being and career advancement.
Social and Economic Stability in Our Communities. This is closely tied to “individual well-being and career advancement,” but it is on the macro-level for society. Horace Mann understood the social need for universal, non-sectarian, and free public education that started in childhood. He brought these beliefs with him as the president of Antioch College where he persisted on allowing African Americans to study at the school. These broad social policies improve the social and economic stability of entire communities. Competency-based education with prior learning assessment is poised to have a similar impact in modern communities. Many individuals who can’t afford or don’t have the time to attend school needs a curriculum that is customized for them and provides them the ability to applying what they are learning directly to their job. Partnering with employers is a great way to offset the costs for students and provide them with a college degree to advance in their career. Competency-based education can reach a very broad demographic of people in need of education and transform communities into more prosperous entities.
Conclusion
Applying a historical and modern perspective to my personal philosophy maintained its value and reliance and upheld its strength as a guiding philosophy I will continue to apply to my career in higher education. Moving from industry to academic was one of the first actions that I took to fulfill this philosophy. I joined SNHU as a Junior Business Analyst working mainly on campus to help departments and stakeholders on campus operate more efficiently and effectively while leveraging data to inform decisions. My personal philosophy is very broad and working towards it in its entirety would be an incredibly cumbersome task. I plan to use it as a guide for my decisions and actions in my professional career, and hopefully, eventually leading a university.",0
13,-1,"Hello everyone, my name is Clay Gendron. I graduated from the SNHU campus in May of 2017 with my Bachelors in Business Administration. Upon graduation, I started working in the finance technology industry as a Production Support Engineer and have been in that role for a year and a half. I made the decision that I want my career path to bend in the direction of Higher Education, so as well as starting my Masters in Higher Education Administration, I am pursuing new job opportunities that will allow me to use my previous experiences along with knowledge gained during the pursuit of this degree to serve an impactful role at a University. Neither of my parents went to college, so I am a first-generation college student, and reflecting on the impact higher education has had on me is a key reason I have changed my career intentions towards education.

I believe most people who work in education have the hope of, which may take many different forms, “changing the world.” The scope can be from influencing one learner or be on the national and global scale. A mission statement that I wrote for myself is, “Develop and maintain educational experiences that promote individual well-being and career achievement that foster stronger economic stability in our communities.” Now, I realize this is not a realistic mission I can achieve alone, so my plan is to challenge myself to pursue this mission through working at organizations and institutions of which this mission is closely aligned. SNHU is an organization I feel my beliefs completely align with. The learner-focused model with a commitment to making a learning platform that is flexible in its delivery, accessible to many learners, and is of the highest quality, proves SNHU’s commitment to “change the world” on a global level. The universities mission statement further cements this commitment.

“Southern New Hampshire University transforms the lives of learners. Our success is defined by our learners’ success. By relentlessly challenging the status quo and providing the best support in higher education, Southern New Hampshire University expands access to education by creating high-quality, affordable, and innovative pathways to meet the unique needs of each and every learner” (“Unlocking Talent and Opportunity: 2018-2023 SNHU Strategic Plan,” 2018).

It was essential for me to develop my own mission and goals before deciding on how I wanted to change my career, and because of this, I have a strong belief that the “place for me” is in higher education.",0
14,-1,"Adult Learning in Higher Education: Reflection
	Improving access and degree attainment for adult learners in higher education is a crucial responsibility for institutions in higher education for its societal benefits along with the growth potential it will give to universities. The phrases ‘untapped protentional’ is one that perfectly summarizes the situation for many adults in this country. Individuals with only a high school diploma have very limited job options that provide benefits along with decent salaries. Technology and globalization have created hundreds of thousands of jobs but have also eliminated millions of jobs in various sectors of the country. Improve access and degree attainment for adult learners requires an understanding of who these students are and what they need to be successful.
	Jobs provide purpose to millions of Americans and part of the purpose of higher education is to enable students to get a job upon graduation. In his book The War on Normal People Andrew Yang (2018) paints a clear picture of what is occurring, and will occur, when jobs are eliminated through technology or globalism. Routine tasks in the workplace, both simple and complex, will be automated in the future if they haven’t been already. Any and all advancements create new jobs that generally pay better than the existing ones, but when speaking for a specific task, fewer people are required to do it. Furthermore, the new jobs created by technology are generally not made in the communities were jobs are eliminated. Take the example of a software company in California creates a robot that is able to answer the phone and is indistinguishable from a human. California will now have more developers working on this software while thousands of workers in different areas of the country would now be looking for new work. When workers are displaced through job elimination, they need new skills and abilities to find new employment. They don’t like the ability, they lack the skills. Joan C. Williams (2017) wrote about why many individuals in communities of economic decline do not move to more prosperous areas. Community ties to friends, family, and local establishments becomes so ingrained that leaving the community would involve leaving nearly everything an individual knows. Higher educational administrators need to understand who these adult learners are and what ideal program outcomes are for these students when developing programs that suit their needs.
	Providing quality education of adult learners is a much different process than the traditional framework. Adult learners have several commonalities, and because of which, there can be objectives and outcomes created for these students. First, pursuing a degree needs to be accessible, affordable, flexible, and relevant in the workplace. Second, students need to be able to apply the knowledge learned in their degree in their communities. School administrators need to design and implement programs that can achieve these two requirements, along with any others the school may have, to ensure schools have quality programs. Adult learning in higher education has the possibility of expanding higher education to include more students and improve the outcomes of many Americans.",0
15,-1,"The article “Graduate School Can Have Terrible Effects on People's Mental Health” written by Alia Wong was one that I came across right before I started pursuing my master’s degree, and I dissected it in an attempt to fully understand what I was getting myself into. The main subject of the piece, Everet Rummel, is and was by all measures a successful student and individual in academia. He graduated with his bachelor’s and master’s within 4 year’s and was accepted into a Ph.D program upon graduation. However, Rummel did not complete that program and choose to drop out. He did not drop out due to the program being too hard are a change in life priorities, Rummel was facing many mental health issues including anxiety and depression which all stemmed from being a Ph.D student. I wanted to take a drastically different approach to the question, “Is your master’s or Ph.D worth it?” by assessing if they are worth the overly demanding expectations that lead to mental health issues. (Wong, 2018)
	Graduate degree programs are traditionally more difficult and rigorous than undergraduate degrees, but many of the challenge’s students face are completely different from those faced as an undergrad. Graduate students face issues not only around academic rigor, but also around having time for social obligations and finical security (Wong, 2018). These issues often compound on one another. Students have school obligations which limit their time to socialize, and even if they have the time to socialize, they often do not have much discretionary income due to the lack of decent paying employment. This makes the student experiences very mental difficult and socially isolating. One study finds that as many as 50% of Ph.D students face mental health difficulties and 33% are at risk or have developed a psychiatric disorder like depression (Levecque, Anseel, De Beuckelaer, Van der Heyden & Gisle, 2017). The workplace requirements for students pursuing a graduate degree, especially doctoral degrees, is far more taxing on a person’s mental health comparative to similarly educated individuals along similar points in their career’s (Levecque et al., 2017). The fact is even more troubling as students tend to not seek help for these problems, even when offered by the school (Waight & Giordano, 2018). Students tend to use family or online resources, and when consulting a professional, will use a personal doctor. Researching Waight and Giordano (2018) provided five recommendations for schools that including providing guidance or “clear signposting” to students, online self-help, workshops, parity of support, and advisor training.
	Not all graduate programs and made the same, but many, especially the highly competitive programs, are extraordinarily demanding of students and offer little support in alleviating mental distress. Online programs offer a more flexible model of education that fits into a person’s life more easily than a traditional model. Schools will need to address areas in which students are having difficulties and help provide solutions. Pursuing a graduate degree should not come at the cost of mental health and I hope schools start addressing this issue and supporting students much like what is done for undergraduates.",0
16,-1,"Reflection: The data set about Apple stock was set up very logically and was simple to follow. I noticed instantly that it was not just a raw data set with analysis but a tutorial on how information was analyzed to answer the business question. I did not really understand the overarching question of “Did we make the right share adjustments over the year?” so I had to make some assumptions when I formed my opinion. Because the question was unspecific, I tried to determine if each buy/sell was the right move and how each transaction impacted the overall portfolio value, which is also not included in the dataset. The dataset doesn’t look at the gains made or losses of each transaction and only shows the value of the stock holding. We also do not know how much money the portfolio manager has to invest which would impact the suggestions given on how many shares to buy. Assumptions had to be made to work towards any analysis.
Comments: Creating assumptions provided context to the data and I was then able to develop further understanding. My first assumption was the portfolio value was initially at least $32,321.25. I got this by finding the greatest amount of money leveraged at one time by the stock holder. Second, I assumed that the business question was to identify the times where the stock went up and down and how the transition of each month impacted the overall portfolio value. The stock value question was easy as the information was already there. My third assumption was that the transactions all took place on the first of each month. After these assumptions, I calculated the value of the portfolio for the first of each month. You can see the impact a particular transaction had on the portfolio value by looking at the value of the succeeding month. For example, if you bought stock on 9/1 you will see the impact that that transaction had to the portfolio on 10/1. Having this context makes the work I did more understandable and will provide others with a method of one way to interpret the data.
Strengths: With a business and financial background this data was rather simple to understand. I was able to quickly make assumptions and form business questions because of my background. When looking at this course overall, my strengths are visualizing data and making it presentable to an end user and my weaknesses are around coding. I make data visualizations every day and am constantly trying to improve them to create a better user experience for the people looking at my reports. I do not have a deep coding background and will need to spend extra time with that to ensure I am fully understanding it.
Questions: The data set did present me with a lot of questions about the external environment and what exactly the client was trying to answer. For the course overall, I generally have questions about industry standards and new advancements in the field. I know this is an introductory course, but I am always trying to apply course work to either work or a project relating to a new concept or idea in industry.",0
17,-1,"Coming Back: Higher Education and the 2008 Recession
The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) of 2009 was a monumental piece of legislation passed under the Obama administration in direct response the Great Recession of 2008. Millions of Americans lost their jobs and those still employed likely experienced cut backs in wages or benefits. This loss of income immensely affected state budgets and forced cut backs across the board, and this included appropriations for public colleges and universities. In the book American Higher Education: In the 21st Century, Mumper, Gladieux, King and Corrigan write a strong and thorough definition of the act and its intentions.
“[ARRA] was multifaceted legislation [that included] a massive infusion of federal funds to state governments, intended to prop up their budgets, which were staggering under the combination of declining tax revenues and increasing state and local demands for health care and social services.” (p. 215)
Despite the federal aid going directly to public schools these schools still had to put in place measures to stay more finically sound institutions. Private school received no direct federal aid from this act, so these colleges and universities also needed to adapt. ARRA was an important piece of legislation that was enacted during a dire time in U.S. history and reaffirmed the federal government’s role in higher education.
Federal Government and Higher Education
	The 10th amendment in the U.S. constitution has been interpreted with refence to higher education that states have authority over operating public colleges and universities. This amendment classifies all powers not specifically granted to the federal government or not specifically not granted to the state’s lands in the hands of the states. With the exception of the five military service academies, the federal government does not play a direct role in operating any public universities. The federal government’s role has been mainly focused on providing financial aid directly to students. The GI Bill of 1944 and the Higher Education Act of 1965 are two key federal laws that shaped the history of higher education by broadening the scope of the institution and increasing accessibility for students (Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). When President Barack Obama persuaded Congress to adopt ARRA it was generally unexpected to see investments in state budgets for higher education as a portion of the bill (Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). Also included in ARRA where expansions to the Pell Grant, Stafford Loans, and tax credits for tuition costs. The federal government has persistently provided finical aid to increase access to higher education for students, but ARRA was monumental because it broke the mold by also intervening with public state schools.
ARRA Impacts and Outcomes
	The 2008 recession was felt all across America, and higher education was surely not immune to that. Following ARRA, which provided much needed investment all across America, the people, communities, and organizations across America began to slowly rebuild. In reference to higher education, the different classifications of schools experience the effects of ARRA and the recession in different way. Examining how public schools, private non-profit, and private for-profit school were impacted brings about a greater understanding of how the event shaped higher education.
Public Schools
	Public schools were by far the most directly affect sector in higher education. Because the budgets of public schools are tied to state tax revenues, when income and employment falls, their budgets will also decrease. Most states have requirements in their constitutions that they must maintain a balanced budget. Declining revenues would have left governors and state legislatures would have to ask central questions about the role higher education played in its community and economy, and then decided how to appropriate funds while weighing in other important budget items like health care and social services (McGuinness, 2016; Mumper, Gladieux, King & Corrigan, 2016). Some public universities excelled during the time after the recession. Large public universities that were able to grow enrollment, impose tuition increases, and focus on recruiting of out-of-state and international students thrived during this period (Brint, Rotondi, Yoshikawa, Viggiano & Maldonado, 2016). Smaller public schools who rely heavily on a regional student body were faced many challenges. Without ARRA public universities would have certainty had to reduce faculty and staff, shrink operating budgets, and increase tuition prices.
Private Non-Profit
	Private Non-Profit Universities took a hit during post-recession and had to adapt in a new climate in higher education. Non-profits generally emerged in a stronger position than public institutions, they were also likely to see threats to their viability because they did not receive direct state subsidies (Brint, Rotondi, Yoshikawa, Viggiano & Maldonado, 2016). The only federal aid non-profits would see is through student grants and loans. Universities had to innovate, and one way they did that was through online education. In the book The Innovative University: Changing the DNA of Higher Education from the Inside Out, Christenson and Erying (2011) descriped this type of innovation as discuption innovation. They define it as “innovation [that] disrupts the bigger and better product to market or service that is not as good as the best traditional offering but is more affordable and easier to use” (p. xxiv).  Southern New Hampshire University has used this method in its online school by having an unwavering focus in providing affordable and flexible educational methods that serve many types of students. The expansion of Pell Grants and the Stafford loans forced non-profits to innovate and expand the types of offerings they had to attract more students.
Private For-Profit
	Private for-profit schools generally saw a surge of enrollments during the time after the great rescission. There were two key factors that lead to this surge; the tough job market drove people back to school and the federal expansion on the Pell Grant and Stafford Loans. University of Phoenix, the largest University in the U.S. during this time, surged to 460,000 students in 2010 (Gillespie, 2015). For-profits started to take a larger share of federal Pell Grants and Stafford loans. In 2004-05 for-profits receive 18% of Pell Grants and 17% of Stafford Loans. In 2010-11 their share jumped to 25% in each category (Baum, Ma, Pender, Bell & College Board, 2015). The influx of grants and lending provided an environment that allowed for-profits to transition federal aid to profits which spurred the expansive growth that they saw.
Opinions of the Event
	ARRA was not only important, it was a requirement to respond to the environment created by the 2008 recession. This act greatly benefitted the institution of higher education as a whole and arguably stopped many schools from becoming insolvent. Public and non-profit schools showed great resiliency in many cases by adopting new practices to adapt to the times. I believe the could have been a few lessons learned from the GI Bill in this scenario to make the situation better than it ended up being. For-profit schools took advantage of the event by implementing unsustainable growth and making profits from government federal aid. When the GI Bill was proposed there were actions that made sure the expansive growth it created, doubling the number of students who attending college, it did not leave student prey to diploma mills. Not all for-profit schools can be put in the category of diploma mill, but there should have been steps taken like in the GI Bill to avoid universities transitioning federal aid to profits.",0
18,-1,"Establishing Purpose for Diversity in Higher Education
	Diversity as an idea in higher education has been around from its inception, but how it is applied has vastly changed. Having philosophical debates with a diverse range of ideas was initially the way schools focused on the topic, but in the modern university, the application has come to encompass the students and faculty that make ups the school. Students with different backgrounds because of factors like race, ethnicity, gender, religion, social class, and sexual orientation have shown to bring different mindsets into social discussions and improve the outcomes of graduates from any given school. Examining how universities achieve diversity, manage the legal challenges they face when trying to do so, and access the outcomes that diversity has produced is essential in understand the current state of diversity in modern day higher education.
Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard University
The organization Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) filed a lawsuit in 2014 against Harvard on behalf of Asian-American students who believe the admissions practices at the university violate the Civil Rights Act because of racial discrimination. SFFA is an organization centered on eliminating affirmative action and Harvard University is a highly selective Ivy League school. Harvard uses a holistic student profile to determine who gets admitted into the school. A student’s race is included in the profile that Harvard creates, and SFFA is arguing that it is using these profiles to discriminate against Asian-Americans (Lockhart, 2018). Past affirmative action cases like this one have tended to go in the favor of the university, but what distinguished this case from others is that this is the first case where a minority population in the U.S. is the subject to more stringent admissions requirements due to affirmative action (Stephens, 2018). Analyzing the two sides of this case is prudent in determining how colleges and universities address diversity in their admissions processes.
Highly selective schools like Harvard have very thorough admissions processes that take into account many different aspects of each applicant, one of them being race. SFFA’s argument for this case is that race should not be a factor schools use when determining who to admit because a “qualified” student may be declined because of their race, while another student with a different race who is “less-qualified” could be admitted (The Harvard Plan That Failed Asian Americans, 2017). It has been determined that Asian American students generally need to have higher SAT scores than another other races to get admitted, and the acceptance rate for Asian Americans is lower than any other race (The Harvard Plan That Failed Asian Americans, 2017). SFFA contests the theory that Asian Americans are overrepresented based on the fact that applications from this demographic have continued to increase while the number of students admitted has stayed the same (The Harvard Plan That Failed Asian Americans, 2017). The argument against the practice of affirmative action is that it goes against the Civil Rights Act which provides protections for any race from being discriminated against.
Sandford University and 15 other American universities came out in support for Harvard by advocating for the strong benefits diversity brings to a campus through measures like affirmative action. In a formal amicus brief filed with the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, these universities cite previous affirmative action cases, like the landmark case Grutter v. Bollinger, that have been upheld along with providing the beneficial outcomes of having a diverse student population (Amicus Brief of Brown University… and Yale University in Support of Defendants, 2018). Below is an excerpt from the Amicus brief (2018).
“Diversity encourages students to question their own assumptions, to test received truths, and to appreciate the complexity of the modern world. This larger understanding prepares Amici’s graduates to pursue innovation in every field of discovery, to be active and engaged citizens equipped to wrestle with the great questions of the day, and to expand humanity’s learning and accomplishment” (p. 4)
The universities are strident supporters of creating diverse campuses and affirmative action is one method they use to achieve that goal.
Student Diversity of Colleges Campuses
	Student diversity is a major aspect of the modern university because of external social influences, as well as, the benefits it provides to the student body. In American Higher Education: In the 21st Century Smith (2016) defines diversity as not only including “race, ethnicity, gender, and class, but [also] religion, sexual orientation, gender identify, and disability among others” (p. 375). Universities need to understand how to achieve diversity along with what it should have for goals and outcomes around diversity. 
How it is Achieved
Admissions and residence life are two of the most important offices a university has when creating and maintaining and effectivity diverse campus. Highlighting these two common offices show how universities can leverage them effectively to create a more diverse environment on campus
Admissions. Because race is so closely tied to a person’s experience in this country, it would be immoral and unethical not to consider a person’s race when making admissions decisions. If race was simply just skin color and held no responsibility in a student’s life experiences or opportunities, then this practice would itself be a form of unequal treatment. The practice only has merit because of the observable role race can play in an individual’s life. Race is only one, but proven important, factor of a suite of aspects colleges should look for when making admissions decisions (Amicus Brief of Brown University… and Yale University in Support of Defendants, 2018). Social engineer through admissions is a responsibility of colleges, and a responsibility that is equal to its other duties.
Residence Life. In the fruition of their ideals, residence halls are where students call home while going to college. It is impossible to understate the important impact strong communities within these halls has on the campus and university culture around diversity. Colleges generally have goals around educating students to be civically engaged individuals beyond the classroom. Because residence life affects and interacts with nearly every student on campus each and every day, it has a unique position in promoting diversity, and an obligation to do so (Gill, 2016). Creating leaders is another common goal many universities share. Residence life can play a crucial role in facilitating student activism around diversity and inclusion that empower students to be leaders (Otchere, Bankhead, &Williams, 2017). All students come to college with their own beliefs and biases towards different social groups and part of the mission of residence life should be to empower students to practice self-refection and create inclusive environments for diversity to prosper.
Goals and Outcomes of Diversity in Higher Education
	Institution of higher education place a large amount of importance towards diversity and creating inclusive requirements, so it is important to analysis what the outcomes are of implementing these programs. College should want and create these types of environments not just because of moral imperatives, but also because it enhances learning and the student experience while attending college. Colleges that have diverse campuses have found their graduates were well positioned to become future leaders, have an enriching educational experience, evaluate the complexities of the world, pursue innovation in their field of interest, engage civility with their communities, reflect on their own beliefs and biases, form and maintain democratic societies, and ultimately, help expand the knowledge, learning, and accomplishment of humanity (Amicus Brief of Brown University… and Yale University in Support of Defendants, 2018; Gurin, Dey, Hurtado, & Gurin, 2002). Diversity is not only a social obligation for a college cornerstone is its pursuit towards it educational goals and outcomes.
Proving its Importance. Why Create Diverse Environments?
In the Amicus Brief (2018) on behalf of Harvard, which was filed by 16 American universities led by Stanford University, there is a brief quote that reads, “diversity is meant to benefit the student body” (p. 3). This short quote sums up this subject almost in its entirety. When looking at admissions, there are of course different opinions which stem from their composition of objective and subjective rankings, but at the core they are meant to benefit the university and student body as a whole, not just an individual. Colleges are not putting down or lifting up any individual student strictly because of their race, colleges are attempting to create a student body that empowers racial and cultural learning that can’t be done in a homogenous environment. When public debates arise, it is usually around a question like, “Why did one student as opposed to another student get into a particular school?” This is the wrong question to ask. A better question would be, “Should race be a factor in colleges admissions with the purpose of developing and diverse student environment?” Diversity is a key factor of the modern university and effective methods of understanding it and how it improves a university should be strategic objectives of all schools.",0
19,-1,"The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning: Organizational Analysis
	The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that has ambitions of joining learning and work to improve learning opportunities for all adult learners. CAEL wants adults have a clear understand of the relationship between learning and work and to empower lifelong learners who simultaneously progress both their educational professional careers. The organizations mission and vision clearly articulate its goals and aspirations. (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2019a)
Mission: CAEL champions the adult learner and brings together educators, employers and regions to create solutions that integrate work and learning. We help create pathways for adults through learning that has recognizable and relevant value to employers. We do this by informing, supporting and connecting three primary stakeholders: education/learning providers, employers, and cities, states, and regions. (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2019a)
Vision: Every adult has a pathway to lifelong learning and meaningful work. CAEL envisions a world where everyone has a clear understanding of the connections between learning and work, with continuous and accessible opportunities for work-relevant knowledge, skills and credentials enabling all to prosper in a complex world — closing the gap between “traditional” and “adult” learners and providing access to lifelong educational pathways. (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2019a)
CAEL conducts research and produces reports along with partnering with its three primary stakeholders (education/learning providers, employers, and cities, states, and regions) to achieve its mission and vision and make an impact through higher education.
Impact on Higher Education
	Examining each major body of work CAEL does to achieves its mission and vision is key in understand that role it plays in shaping higher education. CAEL conducts research and establishes partnerships to create an environment in higher education that permitting of adult students continuing their educational careers.
Research and Partnering with Stakeholders in Higher
	Research is a major foundation in building an organization centered around education. The structure of education, from its general reliance on either state or federal funding, at all levels is generally inconducive to any changes. The traditional framework of higher education is serving students aged 18-22 on campus with completion based on credit completed. In this scenario, education is mainly separate from an individual’s professional career. Formal education ends upon graduation and then work begins with no overlap. CAEL wants to break down this separation. It conducts research in the following seven areas to help improve our overall understanding on how to make better educational experiences for adults. They are prior learning assessment, competency-based education, workforce and economic development, employee career development, public policy, military-connected students and veterans, and adult learning (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2019b). Having insight on each area of research positions CAEL to be an organization that can act as a subject mater expert to important stakeholders and influence decisions that are made concerning adult learning. Outlined below are examples of research done in some sectors listed above.
Prior Learning Assessment. Research done by Rebecca Klein-Collins and Sean Hudson (2017) concluded that students in the LearningCounts program, program that allows students to earn credit for prior knowledge, who were more engaged and earned more credits through prior learning assessment achieved better educational outcomes. (Klein-Collins & Hudson, 2017)
Competency-Based Education. In a report titled “Meeting Students Where They Are: Profiles of students in Competency-Based Degree Programs,” Rebecca Klein-Collins and Elizabeth Baylor (2013) compile the stories or American workers who started college but did not finish, and after many years, are returning to school in a competency-program. This report provides deep qualitative knowledge around students and their backgrounds before pursing their degrees. (Klein-Collins & Baylor, 2013)
Workforce and Economic Development. Sarah Miller (n.d.) lead the workforce and economic development team at CAEL to produce a visual representation of what a healthy workforce ecosystem looks like when incorporating K-12 education with public and private universities to work in conjunction with local employers and public officials to produce a better educated workforce. (Miller & The Counsil for Adult and Experiencial Learning, n.d.)
Personal Impact
	As a higher educational administration student with a strong interest in experiencial learning, especially based around competency-based education, I believe strongly that CAEL is doing work that will greatly benefit adult learners going back to college. There are two key ways the CAEL has impact me personally as a student. The first is that during my undergraduate degree program I belefited from a program that could be considered experiential learning. The Three-Year Bradley Honors Program in the SNHU School of Business uses multiples means of assement. There are traditional courses which still make up a majoirity of the credits, but credits are also gained through course integraiton projects and integrated course competencies. CAEL may not have been an adivsor ot the founders of this program, but producing research and publications around these ideas leads to more general acception across higher education and inspires actions. The second is that I can learn as a student from its research to establish a deeper understanding on the educational models I am interested in. CAEL does not charge users to access its information which is a major benefit to students or educators like myself interested in expanding knowledge of the topic.",0
20,-1,"Directly preparing students for the modern labor market, one that is contently changing, is a key initiative that universities and colleges need to take on to address the needs of students. Edith M. P. Braun and Julia-Carolin Brachem conducted a literature review and analyzed employer interviews to develop an online questionnaire that could be used to identity, and determine the significance of, job-relevant competencies that are universal for all college and university graduates. These competencies are; planning and organizing of work processes, promoting others, leading, dealing autonomously with challenging tasks, information processing, number processing, using information and communication technology, communicating in foreign languages, and physical performance. Outlining these competencies is crucial in developing a better understand on how colleges and universities need to design curriculum for students that better directly prepare them for the labor market. (Braun & Brachem, 2015)
Competencies, as defined in education, are skill and abilities that are exemplified by a student and show whether he/she is able to perform a specific job function or he/she has effectively displayed the ability to adapt and succeed in new environments. The two aspects to this definition are essential because they are both requirements that are in demand in the labor market. To provide an example of each, the ability to code in HTML is the first type of competencies that is preforming a specific job function. Jobs that require the ability will want to see students achieve this competency. The second type of competency, displaying the ability to adapt and succeed in new environments, would be that same student using their skills with coding in HTML to develop a website that achieves certain criteria. Building a website shows that the student has the ability to think critically, and because so, can solve other problems they will face in the future. Defining and understanding what competencies are universal in the labor market was at the center of this research and was the driver in developing the list mentioned above. (Braun & Brachem, 2015)
Application of Research
Higher educational curriculum is the central purpose of this research. The researches outlined a framework of outcomes universities and colleges should enable their students to achieve to best position them for jobs in the labor market. Edith M. Braun is an associate professor who received the Ulrich Teichler award for her Ph.D. dissertation which was about a psychometric instrument the she developed. Psychometrics is the study of psychological measurement. Julia-Carolin Brachem earned her bachelor’s, at the University of Osnabrueck in Germany, and master’s, at the Institute of Political Studies in France, in European Studies. She is currently working towards her Ph.D. about, “teachers’ resignation tendency and its potential explication through individual activity and competence profiles and education policy conditions” at the University of Oldenburg. Edith M. Braun one of her supervisors. These two researches had foundational knowledge in the area of higher education and were able to increase that knowledge by design a study better understand the competency outcomes colleges and universities should be looking at. (Braun & Brachem, 2015)
Research Methods
The methods used to conduct research were multifaceted and progressive. The initial literature review was conducted to gain a fundamental understanding of knowledge from other researchers around established labor force general competencies. There where thirty publications reviewed that were both in English and German. Along with the literature review, employer interview transcripts were examined. These interviews were centered around determining what job-related tasks, activities, and requirements employers found critical for college graduates. This preliminary research helped Braun and Brachem develop the next step of the research process where they developed an online survey. (Braun & Brachem, 2015)
	Effectively constructing the online survey was the most important process in this research. Braun and Brachem utilized the Job Requirements Approach (JRA) which is a method that is internationally recognized approach that determines what employees actually do at work. The researches outlined the following reasons why the JRA method is effective in determining what the job competencies actually are, and not just an individual employees’ ability to perform them.
•	What people do at their workplace reflects demands and requirements of work.
•	The best way to get information about job-related activities and requirements is to ask the employees themselves.
•	Employees are able to talk in a less biased way about what they do or experience at work and how often, rather than talking about their individual levels of competences.
Holding the above true, the responses in the surveys will be about the actual job competencies and not be subject to the personal biases of employees. (Braun & Brachem, 2015)
Purpose of the Study
Researching universal competencies that college graduates were needed once they became employed was conducted by Braun and Brachem to inform, as they stated, “curriculum developers, academic quality managers, policymakers, employers, the scientific community, and the graduates themselves.” Previous research in this area had been completed, but the main focus had been on determining universal job competencies for role that did not require a college degree. Although some competencies from those studies may be applicable, looking specifically at what college graduates are expected to know and be able to perform after graduation is important for all the parties mentioned above. This study, and studies like it, provide a more holistic picture of what types of opportunities higher educational institutions need to provide to students that will enable them to practice the competencies that expected of them by their employers upon graduation. (Braun & Brachem, 2015)
Personal Thoughts on Implications of Study
Competency based and/or online education will become an ever-increasing part of higher education as more non-traditional student enrolling due to access constraints of traditional on-campus experiences. This research can create a profound impact on curriculum designers, school administrator, and students. Curriculum designers can come to a deeper understanding of how to design student assessments that promote learning for certain competencies and areas of thinking. Technologies and methodologies employed in the classroom will need to be adapted to meet these needs. Online and competency-based-education are more affordable for students but are also new revenue streams for universities that cost far less than the traditional model. These new models give universities, especially private non-profits, stronger financial revenues to fight back deficits that most traditional universities face. (Braun & Brachem, 2015)
The conclusions that Braun and Brachem reached through their research will further inspire research from academia and industry to gain a better understanding around universal competencies that graduates should have. Research questions arise including, but not limited to, the following; What are the best educational delivery methods (i.e. traditional campus, online, competency-based, prior learning assessment) for each competency? Do students who are being evaluated on these competencies in college perform better once in the workforce? What competencies/traits are directly tied to better professional outcomes? There is a balance that universities need to achieve between providing a holistic education to students and preparing them for a job. There is some cross over, but ultimately for universities to provide better educations that are more affordable and meaningful to student they need put a strong importance in the curriculum on universal, job-relevant competencies. (Braun & Brachem, 2015)",0
21,-1,"Unlocking Potential in Adult Learners Through Higher Education
            Improving access to higher education for traditionally aged colleges students has been a major initiative of modern educational leaders and legislators, but the advent of non-traditional education methods including online-learning have proved that there is a greatly underserved population of students; adult learners. Traditionally higher education, alike other forms of education, has been the final step before a profession career. Serving adult learners will require revamping this mindset and developing educational models that allow adult learners to work, or fulfill another full or part time obligation, while they achieve their degree. Understand a historical and contemporary perspective to understand future trends on this issue is important in identifying themes that lead to success in educating this demographic of learners. There is high demand and great potential among adult learners who would be able to improve their socioeconomic status if able to attain knowledge granted in a college degree.
            The adult working-class student is the demographic being researched in this paper. An adult learner is defined by The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning as a learner over the age of 22, are balancing a job or another full/part-time obligation, and are financial independent (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2017a). Working-class is defined by Joan Williams (2017) in her book White Working Class as the people in the middle 50%, above the bottom 30% but below the top 20%, in the U.S. family income distribution. The numbers come out to be $41,005 on the low end and $131,962 on the high end. This definition incorporates an estimated 80 million Americans, which is around 25% of the population (Statista, 2017). There is the opportunity for continued growth for higher education in this demographic as only 16% of the 20 million colleges students today are categorized as “traditional” (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2017a). The common idea of “college is not for everyone” has often been expanded to incorporate education and or higher education is not for everyone. Breaking this barrier to convince individuals, and society, that education is a universal means of improve socioeconomic outcomes is how to progress the political, economic, and social factors of any nation.
Historical Perspective
            Educating non-traditional students in higher education has been an objective that has constantly been present from the formation of colonial colleges before the founding of the United States. However, the definition of what is considered “non-traditional” has changed over the decades and centuries of which higher education has been in operation. Non-traditional students have included female students and students from certain religious groups, socioeconomic classes, race and ethnicities, geographic locations, and ages (Thelin, 2011; Geiger, 2016). Improving access for the contemporary working-class adult does not have a direct comparison to any historical event, but improving access for non-traditional learners has an abundance of historical presidents. The GI Bill of 1944, the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the development of Blackboard LMS product in 1998 best detail important events that shaped higher education to be in a position to better serve today’s adult working-class students.
The GI Bill
            The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, which is more widely known as the GI Bill, was the first piece of legislation that appropriate federal funds directly to students to pay for college tuition. Following World War I, the federal government did little to aid veterans as they transitioned back into civilian society. Veterans set up “Hooverville” camps outside the White House in protest and demonstration of the federal inaction (Thelin, 2011). President Franklin D. Roosevelt was in a similar situation following World War II, but also had to nation rebounding from the Great Depression. When the allied victory became imminent, legislators began drafting the legislation now known as the GI Bill. The tuition benefits, which are the most notable benefit from the modern-day perspective, were some of the last additions to the bill (Thelin, 2011). Higher education underwent a fundamental shift after this bill became law. Enrollments nearly doubled from 1944-1946 with 1 million of the 2.1 million students in higher education being veteran students (Thelin, 2011). This helped the country, as well as veterans, transition from a wartime to peacetime economy and set a president for federal spending in higher education. Schools used the investments to improve facilities and the student experiences and allowed veterans who were often of modest socioeconomic backgrounds to climb the social latter and improved their standard of living. The GI Bill was the first large expansion of federal responsibilities in higher education and provided an example of how federal funding can expand higher education and improve access.
The Higher Education Act
            The core initiative of the Higher Education Act of 1965 was to strengthen the financial resources in higher education so to enable schools in providing educational programs to more students, and for students in need to obtain the financial means to attend college. The act was instituted under President Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration and was a part of his Great Society initiatives (Thelin, 2011). Federal grants and loans along with other government programs intended to help students all began with this act (National TRIO Clearinghouse, 2003). The Higher Education Act in many ways was an expansion of the GI Bill to incorporate most, in not all, student in higher education as the federal government understood the societal net benefit of having educated citizens. This act has been amended and re-instituted many times throughout American history to better serve students as new issues arise. Hundreds of millions of students have benefitted from this act and its amendments. The Higher Education Act of 1965 solidified the federal government as an entity that could provide funding to students and improve access across higher education.
Blackboard
            Blackboard was not the first learning management system (LMS), or the first software that allowed for online courses, but it was the first effective solution in enabling schools to easily transition in-person courses to either hybrid or fully online deliveries. Matthew Pittinsky and Michael Chasen first founded Blackboard as a consulting firm to provide technical standards for online learning applications (Bradford, Prciello, Balkon, & Backus, 2007). The vision of Blackboard at the time was to create a friendly user-interface that allowed professors and students to communicate and share course materials online. Blackboard soon merged with CourseInfo LLC, another LSM which was developed by Cornell University, and the first product was released in 1998 (Bradford, Prciello, Balkon, & Backus, 2007). Distance education would be forever changed. Blackboard at its peak was being used by 70% of U.S. colleges for both online and in-person delivery methods (Bradford, Prciello, Balkon, & Backus, 2007). The company’s market share has since decreased to around 30%, competing most closely with Canvas and Moodle, but nearly all courses taught in higher education are leveraging an LMS to improve the experience of students the effectiveness of professors. The technological advancements that Blackboard produced with its first product provided a pathway towards future higher educational institutions to building out fully or partially online programs to improve access to non-traditional college students.
Contemporary Higher Education System (Institutions)
            Accessibility and affordability are the two main issues that the higher education system is facing as it progresses into the 21st century. When concerned with adult working-class workers, flexibility and relevancy must be added to this list (Clerkin & Simon, 2014). Several universities or university systems developed new forms of education delivery methods to suit the needs of these students. Western Governors University (WGU), Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), and the University Systems of New York State, State University of New York (SUNY) and City University of New York (CUNY), are all exemplary institutions in the pursuit of educating adult working-class learners.
Western Governors University (WGU)
WGU is a private non-profit university located in Salt Lake City, Utah that delivers education through an online competency-based education model. Competency-based education is an education delivery method that is focused on students learning competencies to earn course credit towards a degree as opposed to the credit hour system which is focused on seat time. WGU was founded in 1997 by a group of state governors collaborating to develop a university that answered a question the posed to each other: “How can we ensure more of our resident have greater access to a college education that fits their schedule?” (Western Governors University, 2019). The problem the framers of WGU were trying to resolve directly related to adult working-class workers. WGU’s mission statement further details how the universities plans to educate this demographic.
“The principal mission of WGU is to improve quality and expand access to post-secondary educational opportunities by providing a means for individuals to learn independent of time or place and to earn competency-based degrees and other credentials that are credible to both academic institutions and employers.” (Western Governors University, 2019)
Delivering on this mission is what makes WGU a truly unique university.
The fact that public officials joined together form a private entirely to deliver higher education exemplifies how an online competency-based education system is one of the best delivery methods of reaching adult working-class learners. Public educational systems serve a great purposed in the educational landscape, but private colleges have the ability to operate independently and provide more innovative programmatic offerings. The cornerstone of WGU is it competency-based education system. When students take assessments the normal grading structures are not in place. For a student to pass, they need to show they have the knowledge of each competency (Marcus, 2017). This is incredibly important to employers who want to know students have job relevant skills upon earning their degree. WGU has grown from 1997 to be one of the largest online education providers offering programs from is four schools; College of Business, Teachers College, College of Information Technology, and College of Health Professionals. WGU was establish from a question about student accessibility and is now one of the largest universities in the U.S. for staying focused on its purpose.
Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU)
SNHU is a private non-profit university that has a diverse portfolio of program offering and delivery methods. SNHU has a traditional campus in Manchester, NH, a large online college, a competency based educational offering through workforce partnerships, and many other programs and partnerships centered around higher education. President Paul Leblanc states that the purpose of SNHU is to “transform the lives of students,” and especially for students of which “college is not a guarantee” (Leblanc, 2019). The mission statement of the university clearly details the direction and goal it is working towards.
“Southern New Hampshire University transforms the lives of learners. Our success is defined by our learner’s success. By relentlessly challenging the status quo and providing the best support in higher education, Southern New Hampshire University expands access to education by creating high quality, affordable and innovative pathways to meet the unique needs of each and every learner” (Southern New Hampshire University, 2019b)
SNHU is a leader in online education in the U.S. and is the main way it interacts with its growing learner base currently around 130,000 students.
Adult working-class learners require a more flexible degree path and SNHU has built out a diverse selection of program offerings to allow students to choose a degree that is best for them. Its College for Online and Continuing Education is a traditional course framework adapted for an online and asynchronous environment. Students earn credit hours with each course as they work towards their degree. SNHU's College for America or Workforce Partnerships school is smaller subset of the online programs it offers, however, students in this program are employees of a company that SNHU has built out a partnership with. Having both the student and employer be customers of the universities allow for an individualized approach to education for each student and employer (Hansen, 2018). Competencies are a better method of assessing a student’s knowledge and course mastery and employers enjoy the benefits of employee gaining skills that directly improve the business. SNHU built these two educational delivery methods in pursuit of its mission and successfully has educated thousands of learners who would not have had the opportunity otherwise.
University Systems of New York State (SUNY and CUNY)
New York State instituted a groundbreaking piece of legislation that developed the Excelsior Scholarship which provides free college tuition to middle-class New York residents (New York State, 2018). New York is one of many states that has instituted so measure to enable free public college or higher education in the state or is in the processes of doing so (Mercer, 2018). With student debt currently at $1.5 trillion in this country there needs to be large steps taken to ensure that number does not grow too much larger. The financial crash of 2008 made many states lower their budgets and make cuts to educational programs. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) signed into law by President Barack Obama included economic stimulus is many different factions of the U.S. economy, one of them was higher education. A decade removed from the crisis, many states are being to realize the importance of having well-funded state education institutions and work alongside the federal government to lessen the financial burden on students. The mission of SUNY details the purpose of the education system in the state.
“The mission of the state university system shall be to provide to the people of New York educational services of the highest quality, with the broadest possible access, fully representative of all segments of the population in a complete range of academic, professional and vocational postsecondary programs including such additional activities in pursuit of these objectives as are necessary or customary” (SUNY, 2019)
Understanding how New York State was able to offer free public higher education is crucial to understanding how to better adopt it in other states.
            Valuing higher education as a social good is and essential duty of state governments when deciding on appropriations. The new approach of free college is currently still a somewhat radically idea, but throughout history education in the U.S. has been expanding and made universal through social and economic demands. With this historical perspective, free public higher education seems like the natural next step. Traditional colleges students would be able to earn a degree without having to taken out debt, but the real beneficiaries of these public schools would be the adult learners. Closing social gaps in economic equality and workforce skills direct benefits that states would help combat be providing free public college tuition (Perna, Leigh, & Carroll, 2017). However, ensuring sustainability of these free public programs is crucial in their overall effectiveness. State appropriates are greatly affected by the health of the economy and this is a factor that states needs to consider when drafting this legislation (Perna, Leigh, & Carroll, 2017). States like New York are becoming trail blazers of a future educational system that allows student to attend school and earn a high-quality degree with little cost.
Contemporary Higher Education System (Trends)
            Understanding the operations of key universities and university systems working to education adult working-class learners is the first step in identifying trends in higher education that specifically pertain to this student demographic. These trends need to be incorporated into any decisions that a school makes in efforts of serving this demographic.
Mission, Vision, and Goals
            Accessibility, affordability, flexibility, and relevancy are the core of each institution's mission. These universities are characterized as “teaching universities” where research is not a large factor in the university operations. The student focused mission and serving the underserved help direct their large institutions to always act in a way that serves the student they are trying to educate.
Technology
            The presence of technology is ubiquitous in the modern universities. WGU and SNHU need to rely of a robust technological infrastructure to administer education and access students. Technology has been a main driver of growth in higher education, but there is still more room to grow. Comprehensive learning management systems, learning analytics, and the gamification of learning are all sectors of which technology has the opportunity to improve the delivery of education and student outcomes (Aldowah, Al-Samarraie & Fauzy, 2019; Kaufmann, 2018; Gorshenin, 2018). The ability to leverage technology will be how, especially private, colleges and universities of the future effectively educate their students.


Funding
            Funding for college may be the most important issue in modern times. One side is student affordability. If students continue to barrow money to pay for college at the present-day rate there will be economic repercussion in the future. There is currently $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. SNHU, WGU, and SUNY and CUNY are all universities or university systems focused on lowering the student debt burden. Specifically focused on adult working-class learners, these learners generally cannot take out very much in loans and do not qualify for any federal grants. Affordable education options like those at SNHU and WGU are helping solve the problem in the private sector and SUNY an CUNY are two of many public state systems trying to eliminate the student debt burden. The second side is ensuring schools have sustainable funding sources and are able to operate will into the future. Large universities like SNHU and WGU are able to use tuition fees collected from their students to maintain operability. SUNY and CUNY rely on state appropriations are very sensitive to financial swings in the market. The institutions outlined are striking an effective balance of ensure its revenues leads to a long-term sustainable organization and the costs for students is still affordable.
Personal Conclusion and Reflection
            I am pursuing a career in higher education in hopes of being able to move the needle on the number of adult working-class learners who have access to higher education. I grew up in a small town with modest background and college was not a guarantee, or even an option, for many of my high school classmates. I initially believed everyone needs to have the opportunity to pursue a degree in a campus environment, but I quickly understand the unfeasibly of that option. Online education or free community education are the two most viable ways in which I believe we improve enrollments among student who do not fit in with the traditional college framework. There is a great amount of untapped potential among the American workforce that many people, including the individuals themselves, do not know is there. I want to help realize that potential.
            I conducted an exercise in self-reflection by answering several questions or responding to statements around how this issue has impacted me and how I see it progressing into the future. Reflecting on why certain issues are significant to one’s self is a good practice to ensure the overall vision is not lost in the day-to-day demands.
How has this issue personally impacted a me as a student or professional?
My college education has been the most important investment, both financially and with respect to time, in my life. The pinnacle reason why I what to be in higher education is because of my belief that it can be used as a vehicle to resolve many of the difficult social and economic situations American’s faces. Federal student aid and the traditional higher educational model is geared towards the traditionally aged college students who are right out of high school. Investing in Americans who are working full-time or have full-time obligations but have the ability to achieve a college degree could be an incredible social invest the country could make and I want to be a part of a universities that is reaching these types of students. My undergrad degree was a three-year program that leveraged traditional educational delivery methods along with experiential and competency-based education to allow me to graduate in three years without an overloaded schedule and a bachelor’s degree. This not only saved me a year of tuition costs, but also allowed me to get a job and start earning money one year before most students in my class. Education is not about sitting in a classroom and the more universities and policy makers understand the better change we have of seeing a system that reaches all Americans with the skills and abilities to earn a degree obtain one.
Describe how I may address this issue as a leader in a higher educational institution.
Employer partnerships are a key way I would approach this issue if I were a leader at a university looking to achieve this issue. The partnerships could be two-fold. On one side these employers are providing students and graduates with job or promotion opportunities that improve professional outcomes. On the other side these partnerships could be an effective way of employing a competency-based educational model. If employers are willing to provide curriculum designers information around employee job functions, the skills employees gain from doing those functions could be converted into college credit towards a degree. Large national employers would be the obvious first targets for these programs, but a team of university employees tasked with creating partnerships with employers across different regions of the U.S. could create a large framework of potential students with the ability to apply knowledge gained on the job towards college degrees. Prior learning assessment (PLA) has been proven to be highly effective and an affordable way to work towards earning a degree (The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning, 2017b). Employing methods like this that integrate educational and professional careers is the foundation of achieving strong educational outcomes and student who become lifelong learners.
Analyze the mission, vision, and goals of a higher educational institution of which I have personal experience, and how does the institution address this issue.
A clear choice of university to select in this case is Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), and university of which I am not both a student and employee. The mission and vision of SNHU closely align with the issue of educating adult working-class learners. The mission and vision are outlined below.
SNHU Mission: Southern New Hampshire University transforms the lives of learners. Our success is defined by our learners’ success. By relentlessly challenging the status quo and providing the best support in higher education, Southern New Hampshire University expands access to education by creating high-quality, affordable, and innovative pathways to meet the unique needs of each and every learner. (Southern New Hampshire University, 2018)
SNHU Vision: Make the world a better and more just place through our work, one learner at a time. (Southern New Hampshire University, 2018)
Meeting the needs of adult learners who are working full-time or have full-time obligations is not the pathway of most traditional schools, and SNHU is in a strong position to meet these needs as well as any online university in the market. The online aspect of SNHU is still generally a traditional model but adapted for online delivery to be more affordable and accessible. Programs like SNHU’s College for America (business to business partnership to provide employees with a competency-based educational model to earn a college degree) and its partnership with LRNG (community-based model of providing competency-based educational for younger middle school-aged students to older working adults at a minimal to non-existent cost using an urban ecosystem approach) are both ventures focused on reaching learners who the current system does not each and is a true example of it enacted it’s espoused values (Southern New Hampshire University, 2019a; Keane, 2018).
Predict the future direction of this issue and its impact on me.
The future direction of this issue, as it pertains to the adult working-class learner, is leading towards a breakdown of the traditional education model to a model more integrated into the personal and professional lives of students. Online education makes it possible to students to access the “classroom” anywhere in the world that has an internet connection and workplace partnerships allow for students to earn college credits towards a degree while working. These are just two examples of how higher education has changed and advancements in the future to follow this same trend. Educational providers will be creating platforms, similar to other online social networks, that have a targeted objective of providing an educational experience that achieves their own personal and professional goals, on a time that works for them.
The impact this has on me is that in my future professional career I want to work on enabling a university to achieve this “platform” model of education. Without this passion for providing education to all America’s who have the ability to earn one I would not be in higher education, so this issue has shaped my entire personal perspective when looking at my future educational career. Not all educators are in a classroom with students and I hope that I can work to achieve a more just higher educational system that has the ability to reach Americans based on ability and regardless of financial status.",0
22,-1,"Providing Value with Data Analytics
GE will be able to improve its business operations by using data to understand customer churn and implementing changes, based on data-driven analysis, that reduce customers that leave. The dataset that GE has provided to be used in this analysis includes information about the subscribers to its Healthcare IT application. Data ranges from personal and demographic data to behavioral and engagement data that includes usage metrics that describe how clients are interacting with the product. The behavioral and engagement metrics will likely be the most important for building and type of analytical model, as relying on too many demographic type data points could introduce unwanted bias towards certain demographics. It will be important to use the CRISP-DM approach when building out the analytic solutions for GE. The steps to this process are detailed below.
1.	Business understanding: These details have been provided to the analytics team from GE and describe the specific problem the organization is looking to solve, and that is reducing churn. Descriptive analytics will be provided and presented to GE so that organization can understand why, or possibly when do, of its customers churn, and how does churn impact the business as a whole. Predictive analytics for GE will be mainly centered on trying to determine who of its current customers will churn so the organization can respond appropriately. These two elements together will give GE a better understand of its customers, and thus business, along with a proactive tool that alerts the organization of where it should focus current resources. The business still needs to be consulted on the project details on this endeavor, and this would include the timeline, resource commitments, success criteria, and end-state implementation goals along with others.
2.	Data understanding: The analytics team will work directly with the customer account management team at GE to ensure it fully understands the data it is working with, but it will also require the analytics team to develop an understanding of the format of the data and determine what the best models will be or what analysis needs to be conducted. There is still a lot to do before actually creating the model, but an initial concept should start to form
3.	Data preparation: This step is highly contingent on the prior step. Both the data and the end-state goals will influence how the data is manipulated that that is can be prepared for future model development or to be presented to end users in a descriptive analytics scenario. This is also the phase where deep consideration needs to be done on the ethics and efficacy of using certain data points in the model. Biased data will lead to a biased model, so preparing the data for a model needs to be done in a way that does not tamper with the integrity of the data. Included in the dataset are data points like credit rating, occupation type, and marital status. Correlations found with these variables should be examined further as strong correlations may be from bias and not actual causal relationships.
4.	Modeling: Possibly considered, “the fun part,” this is where the analytics team will develop descriptive statistics and statical methods of predicting client behavior with will drive the business decisions of GE. We are suggesting Power BI as a descriptive reporting tool and R as a statistical langue to build the predictive models. A specific model as this time, but a logistic regression, random forest tree model, or a naive-bayes classifier model are all strong models that are well suited for this business problem. These model types are chosen as they do well in classification predictions and handle wide datasets (ones with many columns) well (Lateef, 2016; Statistics Solutions, 2020; Walia, 2017).
5.	Evaluation: This step is where it will be important to have success criteria from GE to determine the success of the model and determine how it is performing. The goal is to predict which customers will churn, but with this concrete expectation, GE and the analytics team need to determine how the business will measure the success of the model as it is making and building predications. The evaluation phase will also be a time to reorganize and determine if there are elements that can and should be added into the predictive model. Customer churn models are best at predicting who will churn when they have strong customer engagement metrics that detail as much as possible what the customer experience is like (Lal, 2018). Knowing this, it would be great is GE was able to provide additional click data on the clients while they are using the app. This would log the actual time spent on the app and show which customers are using the app efferently and which are having troubles, and when. 
6.	Deployment: Making the data analysis and predictions of use to business stakeholders at the moment they need it is of paramount performance for project success, and so the deployment step of this project cannot be overlooked (Bennett Data Science , 2020). Part of deployment is additionally planning for how to keep the model accurate overtime by ensuring it is evaluated and maintained through business changes. 
Ethical Considerations
	Ethics needs to be at the forefront on everything individuals and businesses do, and so that is true for data analysis. The analysis for GE includes data that pertains to an individual’s credit rating, occupation type, and marital status which could all be considered sensitive personal characteristics. A predictive model on customer churn would direct GE to spend more time one individuals who it believes are likely to churn, and so the steps to counteract any ethical dilemmas need to address and ensure that GE isn’t reaching out to customers because of biased demographic data, but also that it is not overlooking customers who do end up leaving. A method to manage this could be to split out the analysis into two phases. The first phase is building a model that is only using behavioral and engagement metrics. This will show the modeler what data is correlated to churn. From this point, demographic data can selectively be added in and evaluated to determine if it makes and significant impact on the prediction capabilities. This would eliminate building a model from the outset that is too reliant on personal demographic data. The final step in evaluation should be a correlation analysis between the significant demographic variables and the behavioral and engagement metrics. If there are two variables, one from each group, that are both significant and correlated with each other, the modeler should likely drop the demographic data and keep the behavior and engagement data.",0

A method to manage this could be to split out the analysis into two phases while having a governing team that decides which metrics can be used and in which ways. The first phase is building a model that is only using behavioral and engagement metrics. This will show the modeler what data is correlated to churn.

Establishing Structure to Perform Data Analysis and Modeling
           Data analytics is a strong tool that businesses can use to make better operational decisions by allowing organizations to better predict consumer behavior and many other elements related to its core business. Analytic tools require a strong infrastructure to be useful to the business, but also that delineates how data moves through the CRISP-DM process. RStudio, an IDE that runs the statistical software R, has expansive functionalities that enable it to be the system that will manage the execution and delivery of all elements related to the descriptive and predictive model outputs. RStudio will allow GE to build the statistical tools it needs to make key business decisions.
Data Understanding Strategies
           Building a data understanding in an analytics project is mainly focuses on reviewing the dataset and building visualizations to gain context, evaluate data quality, and find preliminary insights (Rollins, 2015). Relating to customer churn, three types of metrics should be assessed in this step. These three types are categorical individual information, individual behavior, and other available metrics that relate to the business case (Zan, Shan, Li, & Ai-jun, 2007). GE has available data fields for each of these categories. Important fields to highlight for categorical individual information are recurring charges, customer age, credit rating, occupation, owns a personal computer, and cell-phone user status. Important fields to highlight for customer behavior are monthly minutes, the number of calls, months in service, and calls made to the retention team. Other important data fields in this project would be customer churn, which is the outcome variable the eventual model will be attempting to predict. It is important to assess both the independent and dependent variables in the data understanding phase.
Data Preparation
           Learning insights about the data in the data understanding phase will influence how the data should be prepped before being analyzed in a model. Data preparation is, “A process that aims to convert independent (categorical and continuous) variables into a form appropriates for further analysis” (Coussement, Lessmann, & Verstraeten, 2017). Researchers Coussement, Lessmann, and Verstraeten (2017) identified to main steps in data preparation, value transformation, and value representation. Value transformation refers specifically to steps that change or re-classify values to represent them better in a dataset. This could be handling missing values or fixing errors and outliers. Value representation is aligning the format of the input variables to the model being created, taking in any constraints of the model. In the case of a logistic regression, a continuous variable could be centered and scaled which is adjusting the values of a column to have a mean on zero and standard deviation of one. The logistic regression model can make much better predictions using data organized this way. This step can be revisited after creating the model and evaluation to improve the model's performance. Using value transformation and representation effectively can greatly improve the end-state model performance. GE can employ both techniques to improve its predictive ability relating to customer churn.  
Modeling and Evaluation
           Modeling statistical predictions and evaluating those predictions is part of the last steps in producing an operational model for a business. Just like prior steps, each model creation is specific to the type of question, and selecting the type of model is important as each is tailored to solve different types of problems. Research by a team in the CSE department at the Ramaiah Institute of Technology provides a good reference point for how to design models to predict customer churn (Patil, et al., 2017). The team found random forest, support vector machines, and extreme gradient boosting were the best predicting churn among customers (Patil, et al., 2017). A random forest model is the recommended model to be implemented during the first pilot model, as it is easy to implement and interpret and can handle a large collection and variety on predictor variables. The model and evaluations of that model are crucial in the analytic process and will provide insights to GE that will create value for the organization.	
Pilot Plan
Access and Storage – The project will use the IDE RStudio, which runs the statistical programming langue that is R, as the application to manage all coding edits and updates. This is free software that the entire team can access and download. The actual source code for the project will be stored using Github. Github is a web-based version control platform that allows teams to collaborate on code and projects while all working simultaneously. RStudio and Github have a simple integration that allows for anyone to quickly “Pull” the latest updates or “Push” new updates to the source code. Github can manage access to allow only certain individuals to access the code and can place further limitations on who can make edits.
Data – The dataset for this project will be manually downloaded from the source system at the businesses and then uploaded to Github using the RStudio integration. There currently is not a database connection that the businesses have established, so manually updating files is currently the only option. Updating the file is as simple as having one user who has read and write access to the project source code overwriting the data file and publishing those changes up to Github. Historically references are not required so there is not a need to archive old files at this time. Referencing data in the project, or any specific file will always require the use of the here() function in R. This function creates a local directory for all users so anyone can pull down the source code and run the script without having to change file directories.
Descriptive Statistics – The dataset that is used contains a high number of columns, so including all of them in some form of descriptive statistics would be time-consuming and not provide much value. There will be two methods of providing descriptive statistics on the columns that contain the most important data, a process that is called variable selection. The first is to construct a simple linear model to relationships that show at least some statistical significance. The second is using the final model output to decide which columns to create additional descriptive statistics for. The first iteration of the process only includes the first step, and histograms were used as visuals to describe the data. Histograms are one of the best visuals for showing the distribution of data values for a given column. Further work needs to be done to complete step two of variable selection, and also create visuals that show deeper relationships or correlations that provide a better story of the data.
Predictive Model – The predictive model will be a Random Forest. This is a tree-based classification model. The initial specifications for the model will be that it includes all variables besides CHURN (a field that shows who churned between days 31 and 60) and CSA (a field that shows the customers communication service network). CHURN is essentially the same field as the output variable and CSA has too many specific values to work in a model. The model created from these inputs has a correct identification rate of about 60%. This accuracy rate will be improved, and this will be done by reducing the variables in the model and tuning the model to better understand the problem and how to use the inputs to make better predictions. The final steps will include the creation of additional models to test the performance of the random forest model. If any of them outperform the random forest then it’ll be switched to the new model algorithm.
Deployment – The deployment of this model will involve publishing the source code up to Github and creating a publishable report that details the findings and how to change up operational decisions to reduce customer churn. There is not the need for end-users to re-run the analysis in a daily or an ad-hoc manner, so the analytics team can refresh the model as needed and update the published report to highlight any changes that have occurred.
 
Pilot Model Analysis
	The pilot run of the predictive model yields strong results and findings and continued refinement will create an even more powerful model for GE and its ability to retain customers, but ultimately increase revenue. There are many exhibits included in this analysis and each will be defined below.
Saving Customers and Revenue Implications
	It is important to understand what the financial implications of this analysis are, so the team wanted to point out the relative importance of predicting churn based on revenue. Each customer that is lost means the GE is losing around $57 dollars of revenue each month, $46 of which is recurring which means it is dependable and stable. Looking at a yearly cycle, GE would losses almost $700 on each customer lost. These loses in revenue quickly add up so it is important to develop to develop predictive models to reduce the losses in revenue.
Metric	Value
Monthly Revenue	$57.77
Monthly Recurring Revenue	$46.25

Random Forest Predictors
	A random forest model has two metrics that show the relative importance of each of the predictor variables, mean decrease accuracy, and mean decrease gini. Mean decrease accuracy represents the amount of accuracy the model would lose if the variable was removed. Mean decrease gini measures how important the variable is based on gini impurity index. Model importance relates to the placement of the variable in the tree. The closer the variable is to the top of the tree the more important it is. The visual below will help instruct GE of which parts of the customer experience or what qualities of the customer are the most important in determining churn to better focus long-term retention strategies.
 
Confusion Matrix of Pilot Model
	A confusion matrix is a simple way to understand how a model is performing. The current random forest model accurately predicts customer churn 60% of the time, which is only 10 percentage points higher than a truly random guess. Continued improvement of the model will be done to get the accuracy up to make better predictions. However, as it is right now, if we assume that outreach campaigns to customers the model says are likely to churn are 50% effective in retaining customers that do actually churn, GE would retain an additional 83 customers which equates to nearly $58,000. If the outreach campaigns do not cost the organization much in additional expenses there is already a lot of value created for GE. 
	Did Not Churn	Churn	Error Rate
Predicted Did Not Churn	30.55%	18.83%	38.13%
Predicted Churn	20.07%	30.55%	39.65%

K-Means Analysis
	A k-means clustering analysis provides insight by clustering rows of a dataset together by similar variables to create profiles. In this case, these are customer profiles. GE can learn about its customers using a k-means analysis because each of the groups has a different churn rate and it determines the associated metrics to the groups with high, or low churn rates. We can see below that the first three groups all have a churn rate of above the average and account for a total of 46% of customers. The clustering analysis can be done on incoming customers to predict likely hood to churn or influence revenue forecasting.
N	Rolling Total of N	Churn Rate	Group Number
58	10%	71%	9
134	34%	57%	3
61	45%	56%	4
2	46%	50%	2
129	69%	46%	7
11	71%	45%	10
42	78%	43%	1
35	85%	43%	6
27	90%	41%	8
58	100%	34%	5
 
*Cluster mean values centered and scaled (mean of zero and standard deviation of one) and do not reflect actuals. CHURNDEP was not transformed and is an actual percentage

Key Influencers
	Similar to k-means and random forest, key influencers is a native app in Microsoft's Power BI that does a similar clustering analysis, although this is a tree-based AI algorithm. The key influencers are the metrics that show association with the likelihood of a particular outcome. This outcome can be both that the customer churns or that the customer does not churn.",0
24,-1,"Findings – The findings of this analysis conclude the findings of previous reports that firefighters have higher compensations than police officers. The ability to create data structures allows for quick and accurate evaluations across the two groups. If the scenario consisted of many different employment groups, creating vectors or matrices in R would allow for quick comparisons that can lead to deeper analysis.
Informed Conclusion – The analysis ran in this case was strictly comparing compensation metrics of firefighters and police officers. The comparisons were mad on the average, minimum, and maximum of both salary and retirement contributions. The final data frame created illustrated the differences in the contributions. The key findings were that average salary and retirement contributions for firefighters and police officers were more different than the maximum values for the two groups. This indicates that firefighters, although having relatively similar maximum values to police officers, have more individuals receiving compensation that is closer to the group maximum than police officers.
Looking Ahead – With more information to analysis there would still be the need to organize it through producing values that define the data set and organizing those defined values into data structures. This is key to the later analysis because without common defined values it is impossible to compare two data sets accurately. There need to be a key set of values that define the data and allow for comparison. After the first step, and similar to this analysis, a data frame could be constructed to compare the values and identify where the differences are. There could be more done in this step to compare the differences in profession, like this analysis, or compare different police and or fire departments. These comparison questions would likely come from a stakeholder with goals of developing a better understand of a situation or answer a business question.",0

            The Office of Alumni Affairs has strict financial and participatory goals for the upcoming year. The office wants to improve the pledge fulfillment rate among alumni by 4%, increase individual alumni donors by 7%, increase alumni participations through events or other activities by 5% - 34%, increase total fundraising contributions by 6%, and increase Leadership Gifts (donations from $1,000 - $10,000) by 4%. The achieve these goals the Director of Alumni Affairs will submit a strategic and operational objective for the upcoming fiscal year that outlines the steps to achieve these initiatives.
            The overall long-term goals of the Office of Alumni Affairs are to create strong alumni connections and leverage those connections to achieve the fundamental academic and learning goals of the college. Alumni bring career and industry experience to students, opportunities for internship of full-time employment, mentorship opportunities, financial donations, and other unique offerings. This office plans to support and enable this strong network as it adds new members with each graduating class and ensure this network is a central strength of the college and its community.
Assessment
	Assessing the progress towards the goals of the Office of Alumni Affairs is pivotal in ensuring that the goals are met, even when barriers are issues arise. The ongoing assessment that will need to be conducted for this office will need to be two-pronged approach. The Office of Alumni Affairs will need to be main team responsible for assessing its achievements and ability to reach its goals. This will be a part of its daily operational tasks. The second form of assessment will need to be from the college’s leadership. Leadership will provide direction through its missions and objectives, and the assessment will be on how the office fits into the missions and objectives along with aligning the goals to the mission and objectives. The goals become valuable when they not only meet the objectives of the Office of Alumni Relations, but when they also move the college towards its overall mission.
Operational Framework
	Attaining the goals set out by the Office of Alumni Affairs will require that it aligns its daily operations with such goals. The establishment of an operational framework goes beyond understanding what each individual needs to complete to achieve the greater goals of the office, and operational framework provides a knowledge base of how the office will work as one unit to achieve its goals. Benchmarking, creating milestones, and establishing institutional standards are the main ways the office can create an operational framework. A new operational framework will put the mission and goals at the center of how the Office of Alumni Affairs operates on a daily basis.
Benchmarking: Alstete (1995) defines benchmarking as, “an ongoing systematic process for measuring and comparing the work processes of different organizations by bringing an external focus to internal activities and functions.” The Office of Alumni Affairs, although it has a unique alumni network and position within higher education, needs to establish a clear understanding of best practices among other alumni affairs offices and adapt the best practices to its unique circumstances. The University of New Hampshire (UNH), under leadership of President Mark Huddleston, revamped its alumni engagement model to reach its goals of better alumni participation and increased donation revenues. The school took three existing offices and aligned them all under one umbrella. The fundraising office, alumni affairs office, and office of communications and marketing where now all aligned with shared objectives (Curtis, 2012). Because the goals set out by the Office of Alumni Affairs for Binchely College are working towards the overall college objectives, building a more formal relationship with the current supporting offices could help in developing new ideas and increase the available resources. Focusing on successful efforts to increase funding by schools like UNH will provide Binchley College a benchmark for success and how to attain that success.
Milestones: Milestones will be at the center of how the Office of Alumni Affairs forecasts and then monitors its performance throughout the year. Providing clear and actionable milestones will require more data about when and why alumni donate, but once established, they should take the form of relative year over year numbers and event specific donation targets. Relative year over year numbers provide great detail into how the office is trending towards its goals compared to the preceding years. Reporting will have to be created by the Data Manager so that office can know this information each day of the year to keep a pulse on how it is doing. Event specific donation targets is assigning a goal to a particular event and then working towards that goal. As an example, an alumni networking event put on by the office could have a goal of raising $5000 in individual donations for that one particular event. This goal can be based on previous years and/or the anticipated attendance. These two types of milestones will help better forecast the year and allow the office to adapt and adjust the budget if needed.
Institutional Standards: The mission and vision, institutional standards, set out by the leadership of Binchley College clearly articulate its purpose and reason for existence. Mission and vision are often characterized as forward thinking, but these statements speak to the fundamental attributes of an organization. In its recent 2018-2023 strategic plan Southern New Hampshire University posed the question, “Why do we exist?” (Southern New Hampshire University, 2018). The creation of these provoking questions allows an organization to drill into who it wants to be and allows individuals to contribute to the organization in a more natural and fundamental way. The office leadership must set the operational objectives, but more importantly, these individuals must promote an environment that allows individual contributors to see the connection between their tasks and the institutional standards.
Implementation: The new operational framework will propose a shift in how the office operates and require a clear plan of execution. The main project manager of this implementation will be the Assistant Director of Alumni Affairs. The Assistant Director will work with the Director to clearly contextualize the end goal and how it is impacting students. It will also be beneficial to incorporate other leadership officials at the college to help complete the efforts in this step. The Director will ultimately be the person to establish a direction towards the end goal and the Assistant Director will be in charge of implementing it. However, before implementation, the Data Manager and Assistant Director will work closely to define an optimized method of achieving the objectives. Implementation will require the Assistant Director and the Student Worker Supervisor to coordinate how to achieve the pre-defined and optimized operational framework with the resources available. The Assistant Director will be the main person monitoring the day to day tasks and ensuring the team meets its milestones and conducting evaluations along the way towards its goals. The operational framework has many moving pieces and will be the task of each individual involved to ensure it is successful.
Data Collection and Analysis
The purpose of this data analysis with both qualitative and quantitative information is to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Office of Alumni Affairs and help determine what the next steps should be to address the business goals of the office. The office wants to increase it donation revenues, and the group the office is most concerned about is the alumni over the age of 55. Looking into the upcoming academic year, the Office of Alumni Affairs has the goal of increasing its total donations by 6%. The data analysis conducted revealed possible solutions to reach that goal, but it also determines the need for more information and data collection to develop an effective strategy.
Data and information about the Office of Alumni Affairs was gained by conducting
interviews with staff members, analyzing the pledge rates among different donation groups from 2011-2013, and analyzing the individual donation data from 2013-2015. Each of these methods provide different insights which were all leveraged in the overall recommendations.
Interviews were conducted with the Director of Alumni Affairs, the Associate Director of Alumni Affairs, and the Student Intern Supervisor of Alumni Affairs. These interviews lead to key insights. Tom Fitzgerald, the director of the Office of Alumni Affairs, is chiefly concerned with improving the fundraising ability of the school. Donations from alumni over the age of 55 have been on declined and Mr. Fitzgerald, and the office, have presumed this is due to the individuals getting older, living on fixed incomes, and enviably passing away. We learned from Mr. Fitzgerald that this age group is the one that the office focuses a large majority of available budget on because of the historically strong relationships that had been built with these individuals over the years. Mr. Fitzgerald also explained how Jesse Williams, the Associate Director, had worked on a new pilot program to engage with a new demographic of alumni. This program, as explained by Ms. Williams, was an invitation to graduates of the Native American Studies program to come back to campus and participate in a weekend long educational program that allows alumni to work with student’s excavation projects and associated research. The engagement has been positive and beneficial to revenues for the Alumni Office. Tuition payments were collected from participating alumni and those alumni were also contributing individual donations. The success of the program has Ms. Williams eager to create new similar programs targeting to a larger demographic of alumni but the room in the budget is not currently there. Shelly Braxton, the Student Intern Supervisor, is also working on new initiatives that with the goal of improving connections the office has with its alumni. Ms. Braxton has worked with the student workers to start bog posts in conjunction with the weekend excavation projects. Ms. Braxton explains how student and alumni have a ‘contagious enthusiasm’ about the excursions and the blog posting has been a way to continue conversations and keep everyone involved connected. This qualitative information provides great insight into the thoughts and daily objectives of a few members of the Office of Alumni Affairs and can be used with the quantitative data to create a comprehensive recommendation.
Pledge and pledge fulfillment rate information was provided by the Office of Alumni Affairs to be analyzed and find trends. This data can be seen in Figure 1. Figure 2 and Figure 3 are both based on the information from Figure 1. Figure 2 validated the notion that Alumni (Over 55) have decreased in pledge fulfillment rates over that past three years. However, two donor categories have seen increases over the same period, which are Alumni (30-55) and Alumni (Under 30). Alumni (30- 55) also have a similar pledge rate to Alumni (Over 55) which is 25.1% compared to 24.1%. Alumni (Under 30) have a much lower pledge rate at 14.7%. The increases seen in both Alumni (30-55) and Alumni (Under 30) still leave them behind the pledge fulfillment rate of Alumni (Over 55) which was for 2013 77.8% whereas Alumni (30-55) was 76.1% and Alumni (Under 30 was 67.4%. Staff and Faculty has stayed relatively steady in both the pledge and pledge fulfillment rates over the three-year timeframe, but leadership donations had a sharp decline in pledge and pledge fulfillment rates in 2013. Figure 3 identifies the difference between the pledge fulfillment goals and the actual fulfillment rates for each demographic. This information mirrors the above visual but provides better insight on how the fulfillment rates directly compare to the goals. Each bar is the averaged value from 2011-2013.
	From 2013-2015 the office saw a relatively steady revenue from donations year over year with a 3.5% increase from 2013 to 2014 and a 1.7% decrease from 2014 to 2015 (Figure 4). The changes in total donations within each age group is where there was a greater difference. Donors under the age of 30 contributed 45.4% ($20,100) more in 2015 than they did in 2013 and donors between the ages of 30 and 55 contributed 46.2% ($148,850) more during the same time frame (Figure 5). Donors over the age of 55 had the opposite occur and donations decreased over the same period of time.
In 2015 the total donations of donors over the age of 55 were 58.6% ($159,400) less than in 2013 (Figure 5). This decrease in donation totals was driven by the group’s larger donors. There was a total of 246 donors from this age group, 37 of which donated more than $1,000 in 2013. These 37 donors accounted for 75.9% of the donation losses for that period (Figure 6). Recuperating the donations lost from the older age group will have to be part of the office’s strategy going forward to meet its fundraising objectives.
	Donors under the age of 55 (includes the group under 30 and between 30-55) increased their contributions drastically from 2013 to 2015 and allowed the Alumni Office to maintain a steady donation revenue stream with the large losses from donors over the age of 55. A majority of donations (72.7% in 2015) are from donors between the ages of 30-55 (Figure 5). These donors are in their prime working years with higher salaries then the other two groups which is the assumed reason for the larger and more frequent donations. Engagement with the campus community is the key difference in the donors of the age group who are driving this change. Because donation totals increased for donors between the ages of 30-55 from 2013 to 2015, the average change in donation amount per donor was positive from both 2014 and 2015. Identifying the largest reasons for this increase comes down to one key effort by the Office of Alumni Affairs, engagement. On average, individuals who participated in a campus event in 2014 increased their donation amounts from 2013 by around two times as much as individuals who did not participate (Figure 7). The difference was more pronounced in 2015 as the average donation amount increase from 2014 was between three to five times higher when participating in an event (Figure 8). In 2015 there was a new form on alumni engagement introduced which was blog posting. This method of engagement proved to be most effective for increasing donation amounts. Alumni who submitted a blog post increased their donations from 2014 to 2015 by ten times more than alumni who did not participate in blog posts (Figure 9). Blog post participates only make up 11% of the donors between the ages of 30-55, but the correlation with donation increase and blog post is very strong. Donors under 30 followed many of the same trends on engagement, but the differences were less pronounced, and with a single showing a negative correlation (Figure 10; Figure 11). The data along with the lower donations from this age group do not provide clear information for which a specific recommendation can be made. The overall guidance for increasing donations from alumni 55 or younger is that building upon the current engagement efforts will produce further increases in donations year over year.
Alumni Engagement Plan
	The recommendation for the alumni engagement plan has a main focus on increasing engagement among donors ages 30-55 in events or programs both on campus and virtual. The group of donors makes up a majority of all donations, and with a pledge rate of 25% and 75% fulfillment rate, there is plenty of room to grow and increase funds. The pilot program that lead to the archeological dig that involved alumni showed great success in influencing alumni to increase their donations from 2014 to 2015. Alumni engagement has long been an integral part of the Office of Alumni Affairs with the dinner at the common, baseball games, and class reunions, but with new alumni moving into 30-55 age category, there needs to be a new focus on more effective engagement objectives. This new direction that is being recommended is more of a pivot from the previous directives as opposed to an entirely new path. The characteristics of Binchley College will not be changing, but the Office of Alumni Affairs, in conjunction with Marketing, will be working on creating a new “brand” or perception of the college to alumni. Rebranding is not changing the identity, but it is altering perception, and schools and colleges that successfully do this can see improved participation and donations from its alumni (Stephenson & Yerger, 2014). The alumni in the older age groups felt connected when attending the more traditional events. Although there is no data to back this up, the Office of Alumni Affairs has anecdotally seen that older alumni are no longer able to donate in ways they were before. Implementing new directives that will be able to excite and build connections with a younger alumni demographic will be a successful and sustainable way to create long term success for the office and also the college. 
The archeological dig and blog posting initiatives are great examples of how this can be done. The funds needed to stand up new programs should be diverted, at least partly, from the funds being spent on the alumni over 55. The large donors of this age group are still participating in events and are on average the same age as smaller donors of this age group but are contributing less. Further analysis, most likely from qualitative data gathering, needs to be completed to understand this trend and conclude how funds can be spent more effectively. For donors 30-55, there are key sectors of alumni that can be targeted in new engagement campaigns. Alumni from the art history, anthropology, and chemistry programs are the areas that could see the greatest increases in donations. Figure 12 and Figure 13 show these programs produce graduates with higher salaries on average and currently have lower than average donation amounts per donor. Low averages per donations can be seen by the gap between the line (count of donors) and the bars (total donations per year) with a wide gap meaning low average donations. Increasing the engagement among alumni donors, especially from the key identified programs, through events and programs geared towards this new demographic is how the Office of Alumni Affairs can achieve its donation goals and improve the campus experience for students. The following action items are these specific directives detailed out with implementation guidelines.
Action Item
Goal: Increase total fundraising contributions by 6%
Action Item: Expand Weekend Alumni Experiences
Responsibility Center and Tasks: The Office of Alumni Affairs will be at the center of this action item. These new programs will require a team effort but has specific task for each member. The Director must effectively communicate and market this program to the alumni. This will require engagement through social media and email, but a larger concerted effort on creating the strong relationships that has been done over the years with the older alumni. Connecting in person, either on or off campus, is pivotal to the success of these new programs. It is also recommended that the platform Instagram be used to both share posts and connect with alumni, but also advertise the new weekend experiences to community members. Instagram, as compared to other social media platforms, is “perceived by users as a social medium that ensured they were quickly informed and up to date,” and for running ads users experienced those ads as more entertaining (Voorveld, Noort, Muntinga, & Bronner, 2018). The actual posts, and continuation of the blog posting, would be completed mainly by the student workers with oversight from the Student Worker Supervisor to ensure alignment between posts on Instagram and in the blog. Advertisements will be most beneficial if these weekend experiences are marketing as an educational experience for the local community instead of just a alumni networking event. Academic Affairs and Marketing would be the two main supporting offices on this action item. Academic Affairs will provide the learning outcomes for the experiences and Marketing will assist with the branding of the events.
Timeline: Creating and standing up the new programs should be completed in 3 months. The Alumni and Academic Affairs office will work jointly on this step. Once this is completed, Marketing will assist the Alumni Affairs Office in brining alumni and members of the local community to these events. The new weekend experiences need to be facilitated within the next academic year.
Outcome: The expansion of the weekend experiences will help increase the donations of alumni who donate, and furthermore, is an opportunity for the alumni office to expand its revenue streams. Community members who participate may not be alumni making donations, but they will be paying the weekend tuition rate for an experience that is educational and also very enjoyable. The added funds will help move the office towards its fundraising goals.
Success of the Alumni Office and Binchley College
	Achieving the goals set out by the Office of Alumni Affairs will help drive the organizational success of Binchley College. Increasing the revenues of the Office of Alumni Affairs, both through donations and by other means, allow the college to further invest in its national competitive programs and provide finaical assistance to students who would otherwise not be able to attend the school. The main responsibilities of improving the operations of the Office of Alumni Affairs will of course be individuals that work directly in office, but there will need to be further alignment and partnership with other offices to ensure other goals that the college has are being met simultaneously. The alignment across the college will produce a more transparent atmosphere where the successes and failures of certain tasks can be seen, and improvements can be made appropriately to avoid large short falls at the end of the year. The success of the Office of Alumni Affairs will produce a more successful version of Binchley College that provides great academic programing and enables student success.
Conclusion
	The Office of Alumni Affairs has a great opportunity to engage with and excite a new demographic of alumni, which in turn, will lead to increased donations and improved student success. In alignment with its mission, and the mission of the college, creating new weekend experiences that will improve alumni engagement from different majors along with increasing awareness of the college through community engagement to promote a strong national alumni network that enable the long-term success of the college. The data analysis conducted showed strong correlations between attendance in alumni events and future donations which is validated by the qualitative experiences that individuals apart of the Office of Alumni Affairs which indicated large amounts of excitement and the feeling of staying connected. Building relationships is the way to renovate the brand of the Office of Alumni Affairs and promote the missions and directives of Binchley College.",0
27,-1,"Parental involvement and education are seen as important to ensuring the children grow up being successful student’s in school, and then after, successful in other areas of their lives. There has been extensive research into this topic including Day and Dotterer (2018) who showed a positive correlation of parental involvement and high school student success, Pavalache-Ilie and Tirdia (2014) showing parental involvement leads to both student success and intrinsic motivation for school, and Bridgewater State University (Clapp & Young, 2010) which looking at parental education level to identfy its at risk and/or underrepresented students on campus because of previous research of student trends. The research in this study is meant to expand upon other research that has been done to indicate if certain elements of parental involvement and education play a role in student success and what mixture of the following show the greatest correlations. The Parent and Family Involvement in Education (PFI) Survey was the data source used for this analysis. Two predictive data models, decision trees in Appendix I and II, were created off of data collected in 2016 and then evaluated based on data in 2012 of the same survey. Both models showed that some form of parental involvement or having a higher education level lead to successful students, with the most important aspect being the belief the parents had that their children would do well in school and have longer educational careers. The research adds to the body of knowledge which shows how important home life is in a child’s academic life. 
Research Question
Is parental involvement in their child’s education and/or the level of education a child’s parents receive a good predictor for a student’s success in school?
Research Question Characteristics
•	People – Children: (Under 20 years old) in K-12 Education.
•	Variables – Parental Involvement:  Measured from parental questionnaire (PFI Survey).
•	Outcomes – Student Success: Measured from parental questionnaire (PFI Survey).
Data Set
	The data sets being used to address and answer this question are from the National Center for Education Statics (NCES) and where generated from the National Household Education Surveys Program. The survey being used from this program is the Parent and Family Involvement in Education (PFI) Survey. NCES has data on the PFI from 2007, 2012, and 2016, although the 2007 data is stored in a different manner than the two other years, and because so, will not be used. Other supplemental data and reports may be referenced to articulate and contextualize the analysis. The PFI will serve as a strong data source because it includes a large sample size (2 years of data that include a total of 40,000 plus participants) and collects information on, “school choice, parent and family involvement at school, the child’s behavior at school, grade retention, parents’ satisfaction with the child’s school, family’s involvement in school work and activities outside of school, and factors affecting family involvement” (National Center for Education Statistics, 2018). 
Model Design Approach
The PFI from 2016 will be used to train the model, or build the model, and then the 2012 data will be used as an evaluation data set. The goal is to have the error rate, the rate of false positives or false negatives in the model, be as low as possible while also being similar between each year’s data. If the model has a low error rate for one year and a higher error rate for the other year it indicates it is not accurate, whereas a high error rate in general is another indicator of inaccuracy.
Perdiction Model and Outcome
	The perdiciton model that was built to understand the research question of, “Is parental involvement in their child’s education and/or the level of education a child’s parents receive a good predictor for a student’s success in school?” was done by selecting the specific survey questions that pertained to parental involvement and education level and using the answers as inputs into a decision tree. A decision tree is a model that makes a perdiction of an output, student success, given various inputs and shows how the interation of those inputs leads to the perdicted outcome. Appendix I and Appendix II show what these models look like.
	The results of both models showed an indication that parental involvement and parental education level lead to successful students. The steps taken to get to this conclusion are detailed below.
Model Construction
Retreive Data - The PFI survey data was retrieved at https://nces.ed.gov/nhes/dataproducts.asp#2007dp. The dataset contians 14,075 individual student entries and 410 survey questions. Of the 410 survey questions, 37 were chosen as applicable to the research question and 8 were chosen as indicators for student success. The 8 chosen for student success where based on student enjoyment of school, student grades, qualify of work, if the student repeated a year, student conduct (in school/out of school suspentions and expultions), and student health. A student needed to statisfy each of survey response questions to be labeled a successful and all else were labeled average/below average. The classifcation was done this way to include a more holistic understanding of student success and not specifically on grades or another single metric.
Rationalize Data – Rationalizing the data was a mainly two step process. The first step was identifying successful students. The 8 survey questions used to determine successful students pertained to the students grades, conduct, school enjoyment, health, and if the student repeated a grade. If a student met all the criteria, they were labeled as successful and if not then they were average/below average. 6,732 of the 14,075 students were labeled as succesful (47.83%). Possible issues with this step that may lead to less accurate results are that if any of the 8 answers were skipped it defaulted to not labeling the student as successful, nearly half of the dataset is in the successful category which may be higher than what a subject matter expert would find, and there was no determination between average or below average. The second step was to update the 37 questions applicable to the research question. All answers were logged as a numerical value, and if a question was skipped the value inputted was “-1”. Each column needed to be updated so that if it was a categorical question (yes or no) then those values replaced the numeric values and if it was a scale (e.i. parental education level) then all the levels needed to be in numerical order. All “-1” answers were replaced with NULL to avoid being used in the model. The possible issues with this step is that any NULL values will make the model less accurate and if a survey has NULL values in the first 8 questions used to create the success flag then it is likely there are NULL’s in the 37 descriptive questions which will create coorelation.
Running the Model (First Time) – Running the model the first time providuce the tree in Appendix I. The following 4 questions out of the 37 were used in classifying each survey respondent. More detail on each question can be found in Appendix III.
1.	FHHELP
2.	FHWKHRS
3.	FSCOUNSLR
4.	SEFUTUREX
The key finding was the in the parent did not believe the student they were responding to the survey about would earn a bachelors degree, the student had a 79% chance on not being labeled a successful student, and if the parent did believe they would earn a bachelors degree or higher degree then the student had a 61% chance of being labeled successful. Meeting with a guidance counselor and spending less time helping the student also showed a correlation to a student not beeing successful, and spending more time on home work, 7 hours or more, showed to be beneficail to being successful. 
Running the Model (Second Time) – In the second model the question SEFUTUREX was ignored as it may be a close measure of success for a student. If a student is not successful in school, a parent will not respond with they expect them to go far in their educational careers. It is still beneficial to know this information because another way to interpret the finding is that respondants who do not believe in their students will be less involved and expect less out of them. When the question was removed, the following questions were used to build the second model, Appendix II. More detail on each question can be found in Appendix III.
1.	FHWKHRS
2.	FSCOUNSLR
3.	FSSPORTX
4.	P1EDUC
This model showed the key finding to be that if the parents education level was below a bachelors degree then 60% of students were not succesful. Having a bachelors degree or higher needed to be accompanied by sending at least 6 hours on homework each week to definitively decied that a student would be successful, 73%. Attending events outside of school was another aspect that helped moved students to be more successful when their parents did not have a bachelors degree.
Overal Findings – If respondants believed their child would be successful student, had a 4 year degree or higher level of education, attended after school activies with their child, helped with homework and ensured their children spent at least 6-7 hours a week on homework, then that child has a very high likihood of success as a student. The last finding visiting with a guidance showing a negative coorelation with student success is likiely an indication that a student is not performing well and thus warrented a guidance counselor visit. Altough it is parental invovlement, there are other factors that go into a guidance counselor visit. The model produced accurate results that align with a unified finding and do not contritidict each other. There are multiple factors this model is not taking into account including student school and socio-economic status which it is assumed would also be influencers in a childs overal success in school.
Decision Tree Structure and Evaluation
	Student success is a difficult term to define which each school or teaching having their own interpretation, but a generally agreed upon definition would be one that incorporates a student’s enjoyment of school, grades, conduct, and overall wellbeing and health. These metrics were used to create a ‘Success Characteristic’ which developed each node and leaf in the decision tree model. The input variables that pertained to parental involvement and education where used as the measures that broke the tree down into its branches. The first model for the two was chosen as the most accurate because it has a relatively low error rate when tested against the 2016 data, the training dataset which built the model, and the 2012 data which had no influence on the model. The error rates for both models are incredibly close together which proves the validity of the models but model one just has a lower overall error rate of false positives or false negatives. Both models can be seen on the following pages with their error rates. 
The error rates have been calculated from the tables titled ‘2012 Data’ and ‘2016 Data.’ The column headers in each table identify the actual classification in the dataset of either a Successful student or an Average/Below Average student. The row headers indicate the value that the model provided to each student. The low to mid-thirties error rate of the first model is very promising as overall it is close to a 50/50 split of successful and average/below average students.
Model and Analysis Limitations
	Evaluating the models created provided great insight that they were constructed in a way that its reliability to predict and outcome is relatively across different years of data, but there are limitations to the model that are present because of its design and data set. The largest limitation is that this dataset has been used for classification and prediction in the model. The fields used to make the classification of successful student or average/below average success where based on mostly objective questions including student grades and conduct history, but there were some more subjective questions like enjoyment of school and the child’s health. Individuals filling out the survey who inflate the responses, for exampling increasing the child’s grades and increasing the number of times the respondent helps the child with homework, would introduce a positive correlation with is not accurately representing the situation. In a perfect scenario where each respondent it totally truthful there would be no issue, but this method of classification and analysis has the potential for including correlations that are not factual. The other main limitation is the limitation of fields that were inputted into the model. Select fields were chosen to only include information that related to parent involvement or education level, but this also means the model can only show correlations with these fields. If socioeconomic status, school characteristics, or the child’s demographic data would be better predictors of student success this model cannot articulate that. This model can only show correlations on the fields it was provided and only provides supplemental element is determine what makes children successful in school.
Model Implications
	This model doesn’t challenge or bring any new profound insight into what leads to student success, so what is the importance of this research and what are its implications? The takeaway of this analysis should be that parental involvement and education level do play a role in childhood success, but it is not a strict “do this and get this outcome” result. The model shows how the collection of choses by parents to be involved lead to success for their children, with the most important factor being parents believing in their children to go further in their educational careers. There are specific tasks like helping children with their homework for a few hours a week which is shown to move the needle on if a child will be successful, but it’s the overall involvement which is important. Schools are now more empowered to create programing that could in some form bring parents to school for events to ensure that there is scheduled time for parents to be involved with their children. Law makers and individuals responsible for educational policy can recognize the importance of life outside the classroom is for students and think creatively on how to influence childhood success in more ways than just on school grounds.

28,-1,"A flash drive manufacturing company (FDM) is working to better understand its production process outcomes to make decisions on where and how it needs to invest in research and development in the future. FDM has recorded over the prior 30 weeks the number of defective drives that is has made each week and wants to use this dataset to complete an analysis. The minimum amount of defective flash drives that were recorded in a single week was five and the max was ten. The average number of defective flash drives created in any given week during this period was just above seven. Plotting the number of defective flash drives by week in a chart and running a regression on the data provides some evidence that the number of defects per week was slightly increasing over the 30-week period. The chart is provided below.
 
The correlation is not incredibly strong, each week the expected increase is defects is 0.04739 over the prior week with a residual stand error of 1.335 and a multiple r-squared value of 0.0918. This group of metrics means that the increased number of defects per week is low (only 0.04739), the standard error of the model prediction is high (plus or minus 1.335 defects for any given week), and that the given week doesn’t explain much of the variance seen in the dataset (0.0918 or 9% of the variance). 
	Despite the weak perceived correlation in this dataset FDM should investigate into the reasons for defective flash drives as the slight increase that is being shown could develop into large costs to the business very soon in the future. 0.04739 may not seem like a large increase in defects expected for a given week, but if this rate continues for a year that is an additional 2-3 defects which works out to be around a 35% increase from year start to year end in defects per week. FDM should determine and provide additional operations metrics than can better describe the weekly number of defects to allow the analytics team to provide a deeper analysis that can look at the possible causes of producing defective products.",0
